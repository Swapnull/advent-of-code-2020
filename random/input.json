Hopefully my vit d & cholesterol are now within range…. If they are & my blood test results are all okay  Will I be in a position to start the injections.  I know my GP had an email conversation with someone about starting me on the injections. They sent recommendations on starting me on 0.25 then increasing to 0.50….but nothing has happened.  I am trying so hard to get this weight off. I’ve lost 12 kg on the 12 week morelife course…. But I am so limited due to my physical ability / disability.

They confirmed they did first weekly dose with this pen but when their second dose was due on Friday 3/01/2025- plunger was jammed. They have tried using alternative needle too but said it does not work. I am not sure what is the issue.  I shall ask them to send photo/ but not if photo can tell anything- they had successfully used all 4 weekly doses for 0.25mg pen and 1 weekly dose of 0.5mg. Can you please guide. Should we report faulty pen and prescribe replacement 0.5mg pen to client. Can you please support prescription if suitable.

My weightvthis morning is a frightening 137.10kg.  I got a quardiobase Scale. This is supposed to be more accurate but OMG!!!. Probably means my old scale wasn't working? Can't believe I've actually put on 18kg in the last  month. HELP!!! Regards  Adeola \n2/13/24 17:26: Hi Adeola If you can stay behind for 5 mins after tonight session we can discuss this? The difference between the scales is very high however your old scales which you used each week we did see a downward trend which means you have been losing weight. Now obviously you are now using different scales and they will give a different reading and may be more accurate  but if you was to of used these from the start im confident we would also of seen a downward trend. We might need to monitor this over the next few weeks. Have you been calorie counting and how have your energy levels been? Kindest regards  \n2/15/24 16:48: Spoke with Adeola  im going to need to change her data as her old scales are a huge difference from her new ones- her weight is drastically higher and although we can see that she was losing weight i will need to recalculate her calories based on her new number. ill put her weight in as the same for the first 5 sessions.\n3/11/24 15:16: PCS REQUESTED CC CLIENT REGARDING NHS APP\n4/16/24 7:29: pcs recieved no meds Chol 5.5 suitable for wegovy (meds requested)\n4/16/24 10:34: meds uploaded\n5/30/24 11:34: Hi Claire  I understand that you have been sent all the details.

I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID-19 or possibly infectious. I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID-19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a pre-existent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat Yes Q19.

She asked when I would be doing her engagement call as she wanted to speak to me and we agreed to conduct the call then and there. She said that her mum suffers from Lipodema and this makes things very difficult. She reported that Lipodema doesn't respond to weight management techniques  but did say her mum did need to lose weight. She was concerned that our advice wouldn't be applicable to her mum. Her GP wants her to start injections as he believes that this will help with the Lipodema. My advice was to stay on with us as the weight loss injections are likely to be prescribed through ourselves. she was concerned they were wasting our time. I said  not at all. Healthy eating and physical activity is beneficial for anyone  and many of the things we talk about may help her to keep up the healthy diet she says they are currently following. They will let me know how they get on.\n2/28/24 14:31: pcs requested\n3/1/24 10:15: pcs uploaded\n3/1/24 12:03: called to book appointmetn for wegovy.

            "answer": "Date and time: 31/03/2025 at 15:30. Incident during psychology coaching session 3, phone call. Chelsea explained that approximately two weeks prior, she experienced hearing voices of a \"man\", which was external to her own thoughts and voice. She reported this led to a \"breakdown\", in regards to her mental health and severe anxiety. She had thoughts that she would die and that her son would die. She reported a thought that, \"maybe it would be easier if I ended it\", and said this was in response to reducing her anxiety. She also reported experiencing intrusive images when in the community, of people being hit by cars, but she understood that these events did not take place. She explained that she has since been reviewed by her GP regarding this. She was referred by her GP to ARMS, a psychosis mental health service. She said this referral was rejected. She said she has the contact details of a crisis mental health team. Signposting and a safety plan was completed. Chelsea said she is not longer feeling in crisis with her mental health. She said she continues to feel anxious and that she may die before her son is 20 years old, as the voice she experienced said. However, she said this is manageable and said she felt this was \"silly\", in terms of the voice and images she experienced.\n\n MDT outcome \npatient discussed at MDT due to recent SG concerns\nDeemed as no immediate risk and unlikely causation for MH deterioration\nalso noted approaching weight check point and not yet achieved it.",

Currently on 1mg and reports sulphur burps have reoccurred  no reported heartburn/reflux issues. She has been to the chemist and had OTC rennies? Reports she is unsure of what the medication name is  and told by pharmacist not to buy anymore. She feels she has balanced meals  still working on having BF meal. On occasions has biscuits or a packet of crisps. She would like to remain on 1mg for now.  Discussed: - Sulphur rich foods - Maintaining a balanced diet and small frequent meals - Remaining well hydrated Client also mentioned GP hasn’t received email from our team  wasn’t sure what she was referring to and what letter she was waiting for  advised that GP would normally prescribe PPI if reporting any symptoms.  - Email Prescriber/RB regarding dose and next prescription for 2 months. Advised may be suitable to continue 1mg for next 2 months. \n11/27/24 17:17: Email to ZA/RB regarding next prescription: Hi Zeenah/Ranjana  I have called the client  I reviewed her in October  for which she reports her symptoms of acid reflux and sulphur burps were resolved since moving back to lower dose of 1mg. However  after being on it for a month now  she reports experiencing sulphur burps again  not as much as when she moved up to the 1.7mg dose. She seems happy to stay on the 1mg for another dose till her 12 month survey is sent. She reports no issues with heartburn  and has been going to the pharmacy to get rennies? She is unsure of the name of the medication  reports she has been told by pharmacist to not take any more than she has. Discussed diet  around experiencing sulphur burps and how this can be common with gastric emptying  she is working on incorporating BF meal and discussed aiming for small frequent meals.  @Zeenah Araimwould you recommend she remains on the 1mg dose? and if so could you issue a prescription for this for the next 2 months please.  She mentioned about a letter being sent from our service to the GP  unsure if this is recommending PPI? I cant see this on the system.  Thanks  Keisha. \n11/27/24 17:18: Client email to service - Wegovy: Hello I didnt know I needed to let anyone know how the 1 was doing as we said we would do 1 more pen of 1 before going upto 1.7 dose. On the 1mg I'm doing OK weight this morning was at 16st11 the sulphur burps are still horrendous chemist told me that I can't buy more over the counter meds for it but despite you guys emailing my doctors multiple times about it I still can not get anywhere with them. Had a few days where I had loose stool but seems to be settling I think after 1 more 1mg pen my body will be coping ready to go up to 1.7  Food noise still controlled still losing weight sulphur burps still bad hair loss still have but is less and still getting tierd for a day or 2 after the injections but that is also a mix of my medical issues making me tierd.

I’m about to start with Morelife and they require some of my medical history. I’ve tried to use the NHS App to access my latest blood tests but it wouldn’t work.  Are you able to share my latest blood tests with Claire in copy? I may have had lipids in a prior test as well. If possible can you also share my history and medicine list? I’ll provide my blood pressure reading as I have a machine at home.  Please let me know if there are any issues or if I need to fill in any forms?  Thanks Claire \n7/11/24 10:43: Trulicity  - not eligible for wegovy\n7/11/24 10:45: Good morning Claire I can see you are prescribed Trulicity  because you are already on GLP-1 RA class of medication from your GP/ Diabetes team you are not eligible for Wegovy at MoreLife.  The use of Wegovy with other GLP-1 RA medication is contraindicated.    Kind regards Claire\n7/11/24 10:49: Hi Claire I was only given Trulicity as I was waiting for Wegovy. I haven’t taken any for almost 6 weeks anyway as it’s been unavailable. I want to come off that and onto wegovy. \n7/11/24 11:14: Hi Claire  Please see below: As per agreement with our Commissioners'  clients with diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes and already on GLP-1 RA medication  shall continue support with primary care / diabetes team. They should not stop their GLP-1 RA medication for accessing Wegovy at More Life. Thus client should get back to their GP for further support. Kind regards Claire \n7/11/24 12:59: I understand  but I was not put on trulicity for diabetes reasons  it was seen as the only option for me as I’d been taken off saxenda over a year ago and I wanted to prevent further weight gain.  I am now stuck between a rock and a hard place  can you help me navigate this please as I was always meant to go on wegovy but I had to wade through the red tape of these new rules.  I presume if they agree to stop my trulicity as medically indicated then wegovy can be an option. I am very depressed about my weight and need this option that I’ve waited so long for.  @thurrockhealthcentre is doctor Sophie still at the practice? She was the one that put me on trulicity but for attempted weight loss. Her notes should back that up?\n7/11/24 12:59: Hi Claire    I shall speak to client tomorrow at 11.30 am if suitable. They should be able to access other alternative (GLP-1 RA)  through their GP/ Diabetes Team in view of shortage of Trulicity.   Let me know if client is available for tomorrow 11.30 am.   Thanking You   Regards Ranjana Babber\n7/11/24 14:49: I’m away until Saturday at the moment  please can it be next week? \n7/16/24 10:52: Confirmation Email and MLP\n7/18/24 10:23: Hi Claire  I have just spoken to the doctors and they have stopped my trulicity  do you need me to send you proof? Also? Are the online classes due to start tomorrow as I haven’t had any invites? Lastly  is there another appointment for the dietitian?  Thanks Claire \n7/18/24 14:47: RB called client and left a voice mail to call back today beofre 4pm or I can contact her tomorrow at 9.30 am\n7/19/24 9:03: RB spoke to client regarding access to wegovy at MoreLife and she should not stop the GLP-1RA medication with GP. Client stated their HbA1c is 49mmol/mol and has has good glyemic control over past and she was put on trulicity by their GP following Saxenda shortage. She said that their  GP has stopped trulicity as it is not clinically indicated and she has proof of it- GP has all records. Asked if trulicity is stopped due to current national shortage- GP shall be able offer alternatives (referred Diabetes UK website recommendation that ttps://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-us/news-and-views/our-response-serious-supply-issues-drugs-people-living-type-2-diabetes). However client insisted it is not stopped due to shortage. RB has explained that she will forward this to our More Life Team  (EC/ Service manager) and get back by next week for next steps.\n7/19/24 13:45: HERRING  Roselle (MID AND SOUTH ESSEX NHS FOUNDATION TRUST) ? BABBER  Ranjana (MORELIFE) ? ?+2 others ? ? Hi She is being prescribed Trulicity for type2 diabetes management. The patient contacted the GP via telephone to discontinue the prescriptions on the 17th July. There is no evidence of a consultation with her GP.  She was previously on Saxenda which was discontinued  in July 2023. She has also tried orlistat in the past. I would suggest we ask the GP to confirm in writing that they are no longer prescribing GLP-1 for her and that she does not meet the local criteria for GLP-1 for her diabetes control. It is likely that her Hba1c will be higher in 3 months if she stops taking Trulicity.

I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID19 or possibly infectious. I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a preexistent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat No Q19.

Then I sent a text showing the location of the Church ready for their first session.\n9/15/23 14:45: recap email sent to all clients: Hello  Please find information below on what was covered during session 1. If you missed the session it’ll help you catch up. If you were there  it’s just a handy recap. We want to firstly welcome you to MoreLife  we look forward to supporting you during this amazing journey. The sessions are designed to give you a greater understanding of how to manage your weight realistically and sustain long term weight loss. Our programme includes 12 weekly sessions which are 1 hour and a half duration along with 8 monthly follow up sessions lasting 1 hour.  We would like to direct you to your handbook to pages 1-19 are relevant to our first session (section 1: getting started) – I would encourage you to take some time to fill out page 8 – ‘why now’  think about/answer questions on pages 9-10 too. It may also be beneficial to make a note of your starting weight/measurements on page 12 and keep a record of your monitoring progress each week. Page 13 is about setting goals – have a think about if you have any long-term goals and make a note of these.  You’ll also set a weekly goal every week. But week 1’s goal is always the same – Keep a food diary! We recommend keeping a food diary throughout the programme to help maintain awareness  you can record a food diary in different ways (we discussed the various methods in our session: apps for example My Fitness Pal which is FREE to download  or My net diary  or (if you want a paid app) Nutracheck  phone notes  pictures  electronic/written diaries etc.) The format is far less important than the accuracy. Pick something you think is doable for you. I’ve attached some bits that may prove useful. If you’d like a food diary template one is attached. But you don’t have to use it. You can keep a food diary in whatever way works for you. I’ve also attached a sheet for you to record your goals week by week. You can use this if you like. Some people prefer to write their goals on their weight recording sheet. Again  whatever works. Lastly  you should have received a log in for an online platform called ‘mylifeplan’. This is our digital platform. I encourage you to log in to this. It’s got several videos and resources on there  and every week that you log in you unlock some new content. If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact with me via e-mail  call and text ?  My best wishes for a great week and I’ll see you all next week!

I just wanted to confirm that you have been booked onto our 1pm virtual group starting on Wednesday 10th January. Please allow up to an hour and a half for the session and sessions will be at the same day/time each week for 12 sessions. This is the first phase of your programme with us which will be followed by 8 monthly maintenance sessions. Darragh  will be your practitioner and he will contact you before the start of your group to introduce herself and explain the next steps. Alongside your Zoom sessions you will be given access to our digital programme ‘My Life Plan’ which will help compliment the live Zoom sessions with your practitioner each week. This digital programme will allow you to set up your own profile  access weekly videos  record your weight  set goals  access useful resources on wellbeing  physical activity  mental health and recipes. To enable you to receive the full benefits of our programme  we recommend attending all the Zoom sessions with your practitioner and watch the videos via ‘My Life Plan’ each week. Please do ask your practitioner if you have any questions.  The link to ‘My Life Plan’ programme will be sent to you shortly. This will come from the email address – noreply@more-life.co.uk. This may go into your junk mail or spam so please keep an eye out for it. During the Zoom sessions we recommend having cameras switched on to enable you to interact with your practitioner and the other participants  if you have any concerns with having your camera switched on during the group sessions  please do speak with your practitioner.  If you have any other questions or queries  please do not hesitate to contact either myself or your practitioner. Best wishes \n1/4/24 13:59: Engagement call done - asked about what MH services she was interested in  was more related to thought processes leading in to a weight loss attempt (destructive thinking) explained we will cover this topic and had a chat about it and she seems happy that we will be doing this.\n2/13/24 17:00: Hi Darragh  I hope you're well.  I'm really enjoying the sessions  much more than I thought I would! ? A lot of what we are learning I've touched on before  but I'm not putting too much pressure on myself  just being very mindful and open-minded.  I've just weighed myself and am 17st13lbs which I'm chuffed with! I've been much more mindful with my food & portion sizes and not pressuring myself to clear the plate. I'm a little concerned about when we get to the physical activity part - I suffer from sciatica  hip pain and a prolapsed disc  so can often find aerobic activity very painful. This being said  I do walk the dog when I can  albeit not for miles like I used to. Thank you for checking in.  I'm looking forward to our next session ?

We need confirmation that she has a weight related comorbidity. Patient has mentioned hypertension but this is not on her PCS  we also need to understand her mental health issues. I note suicidal ideation mentioned and bulima. Keisha can you explore this when you do her initial assessment? I am not concerned about the PBC. Roselle \n10/24/24 8:37: Email sent to CB and Dr Herring - 65441 Hi Claire  I had a look at client 65441 (3 week review). I think there’s some confusion as Claire Mckee has documented that this client has liver issues but I think this was a mistake as client 65343 has this instead  so she may of duplicated notes on this client too.  I’ve checked through 65441 medical Hx on PCS and could only see the following: -\tDepression -\tSmoker -\tOsteopenia -\tMacular disorder -\tHypertension (HTN) – but this is ticked on MCG not on referral (can see from notes she is on BP medication- does this need to be confirmed by GP) BMI- 56.9kg/m2  I can see Rupy reviewed bulimia and suicidal ideation reporting the following:  Client is suitable for programme. She does experience suicidal ideation however her children and grandchildren are her protective factors. Client experienced bulimia seven years ago and then towards the end of November 2023  where she intentionally vomited. She did this for two weeks: it was daily in the first week and then only once the second week. However  she feels her bulimia is in control and has not done it since. Client is keen to make long term changes to her overall health and weight. She is ready to make this changes and take part in the programme. She is keen to monitor food intake  learn new habits and start making tangible changes. Client is a bit nervous about being in a group but feels her confidence will grow over time.\t \t Can she be booked for an initial assessment to assess  I cant see Claire McKee notes uploaded  from 2/10/24. Then I’m happy to review her for the 3 week dietetic review. Keisha Chauhan  Specialist Weight Management Service Dietitian \n10/24/24 8:52: Dear Shelia.

I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID19 or possibly infectious. I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a preexistent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat Yes Q19.

Spoke to client but she has no questions and her questionnaire didn't flag up any issues. She is looking forward to starting the group.\n9/15/23 14:45: recap email sent to all clients: Hello  Please find information below on what was covered during session 1. If you missed the session it’ll help you catch up. If you were there  it’s just a handy recap. We want to firstly welcome you to MoreLife  we look forward to supporting you during this amazing journey. The sessions are designed to give you a greater understanding of how to manage your weight realistically and sustain long term weight loss. Our programme includes 12 weekly sessions which are 1 hour and a half duration along with 8 monthly follow up sessions lasting 1 hour.  We would like to direct you to your handbook to pages 1-19 are relevant to our first session (section 1: getting started) – I would encourage you to take some time to fill out page 8 – ‘why now’  think about/answer questions on pages 9-10 too. It may also be beneficial to make a note of your starting weight/measurements on page 12 and keep a record of your monitoring progress each week. Page 13 is about setting goals – have a think about if you have any long-term goals and make a note of these.  You’ll also set a weekly goal every week. But week 1’s goal is always the same – Keep a food diary! We recommend keeping a food diary throughout the programme to help maintain awareness  you can record a food diary in different ways (we discussed the various methods in our session: apps for example My Fitness Pal which is FREE to download  or My net diary  or (if you want a paid app) Nutracheck  phone notes  pictures  electronic/written diaries etc.) The format is far less important than the accuracy. Pick something you think is doable for you. I’ve attached some bits that may prove useful. If you’d like a food diary template one is attached. But you don’t have to use it. You can keep a food diary in whatever way works for you. I’ve also attached a sheet for you to record your goals week by week. You can use this if you like. Some people prefer to write their goals on their weight recording sheet. Again  whatever works. Lastly  you should have received a log in for an online platform called ‘mylifeplan’. This is our digital platform. I encourage you to log in to this. It’s got several videos and resources on there  and every week that you log in you unlock some new content. If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact with me via e-mail  call and text ?  My best wishes for a great week and I’ll see you all next week!

EGFR INTERPRETATION: Result is compatible with Stage 3B CKD. Pt has a hx of diabetes and told by her GP that she has acue renal disease but was never seen under a renal team . she has regular blood test and nothing was ever mentioned to her re this. Would it be ok to start her on Wegovy and monitor renal fx 3 monthly with GP ? Many thanks Zeenah Hi  Yes  Wegovy is not excreted via the kidneys so is fine to prescribe Do look at their other diabetes medication to see if any adjustments are required i.e. stopping ddp-iv and SU Roselle \n11/28/24 12:57: initial assessment for wegovy pathway conducted. paient has consented.

I have attended the monthly meetings on Zoom but I am not getting anything from them.  They are only going over the same things that were presented at the face to face meetings and the Zoom meetings are held with other groups members who are strangers to me. I am not happy discussing my problems of taking Wegovy with the group on line as I don't know them and to go into details of having excess wind  sickness and diarrohea with a group of strangers is not what I feel comfortable with. Following the face to face meetings we were told of the Zoom meeting plan but a few of us agreed that this was not what we wanted and we arranged to meet up as usual on a Tuesday to weigh and discuss our progress.  Since then a group of between 3 and 5 of us have met every Tuesday at my house.  We weigh  have a cup of coffee and discuss our week and any problems that have arisen.  We have all agreed that the Zoom meetings are not for us and we get nothing from them.  We get more from our once a week meeting with each other. I have emailed Sinead pointing out the problems that I have with Zoom and asking her if she would like to have any input to our once a week meetings and asking her for any incentive for me to continue with the Zoom meetings.  I have not had any reply but I have received a reminder of the next Zoom meeting. I understand that my attendance at the Zoom meetings is contractual with continuing with the Wegovy programme but I am seriously wondering why I have to go over and over the same things  that I am not comfortable discussing my problems with strangers and I get more from the face to face meetings at my house. Please can you assure me that if I drop out of the Zoom meetings I will still be considered to be on the programme or give me a reason why I should consider continuing with these meetings. Thank you. Regards  Barbara Taylor \n2/18/25 17:02: Response to client: Hi Barbara   I hope you are well. Thank you for getting in touch with us.  I am writing to you to respond to the email you sent to our Wegovy inbox today 18/02/2025.  I am sorry to hear that you are not enjoying the monthly sessions  I understand the transition from face-to-face to online can be challenging and provide a different experience. I do appreciate the feedback you’ve provided  the monthly sessions can be recapping a lot of the same information from the weekly stage but it serves as a reminder of the content and to re-enforce the information. We have recently made some changes to our curriculum for the monthly stage so you will see some different topics coming up over the next few months. The maintenance stage is really an opportunity for additional support while you put into practice the guidance shared during the weekly stage.  Please don’t feel like you have to share anything that you don’t feel comfortable with the group. All contributions you make are entirely up to you. We would discourage discussing your Wegovy prescription and side effects with the group as the practitioner facilitating the group is not part of the Wegovy pathway so not the best person to support you with any queries/problems. It would be better discussed in your appointments with the Wegovy team. There will also be a large number of clients in the group who are not receiving the Wegovy medication.  It is great that your previous group still meets regularly in person and that you’re finding those meet ups helpful  we would only encourage anything that supports you with your weight management. However we wouldn’t be able to be involved directly with activities that occur outside of our programme.  NICE guidelines state that clients who are prescribed Wegovy have to be actively participating in a Tier 3 weight management programme in order to access Wegovy medication https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta875/chapter/1-Recommendations. The rationale for this is that results from clinical trials show people lose more weight with semaglutide alongside supervised weight management support than with the support alone. The Mid and South Essex ICB have set an attendance criteria of 6 out of 8 monthly sessions in order to qualify for the medication. Unfortunately if you drop out of our weight management programme your place on the Wegovy pathway would be affected.  If you’d like me to call you to discuss the above information I am happy to do that.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks   Orla McMahon \n3/11/25 7:07: 2.4mg x 1 issued",

Kind regards The MoreLife Team\n5/23/23 0:00: Alison called to see how long she needs to wait for a place on the programme- as she has been waiting since December 2022\n12/14/23 14:40: vm/text re 6pm - 16.1.24\n12/14/23 14:45: EQ sent re 6pm - 16.1.24\n12/18/23 12:18: EQ completed - booked 6pm - 16.1.24\n12/29/23 13:47: MLP/conf email sent = Good afternoon It was a pleasure speaking with you. I just wanted to confirm that you have been booked onto our 6pm virtual group starting on Tuesday 16th January. Please allow up to an hour and a half for the session and sessions will be at the same day/time each week for 12 sessions. This is the first phase of your programme with us which will be followed by 8 monthly maintenance sessions. Darragh  will be your practitioner and he will contact you before the start of your group to introduce herself and explain the next steps. Alongside your Zoom sessions you will be given access to our digital programme ‘My Life Plan’ which will help compliment the live Zoom sessions with your practitioner each week. This digital programme will allow you to set up your own profile  access weekly videos  record your weight  set goals  access useful resources on wellbeing  physical activity  mental health and recipes. To enable you to receive the full benefits of our programme  we recommend attending all the Zoom sessions with your practitioner and watch the videos via ‘My Life Plan’ each week. Please do ask your practitioner if you have any questions.  The link to ‘My Life Plan’ programme will be sent to you shortly. This will come from the email address – noreply@more-life.co.uk. This may go into your junk mail or spam so please keep an eye out for it. During the Zoom sessions we recommend having cameras switched on to enable you to interact with your practitioner and the other participants  if you have any concerns with having your camera switched on during the group sessions  please do speak with your practitioner.  If you have any other questions or queries  please do not hesitate to contact either myself or your practitioner. Best wishes \n1/15/24 16:43: Call Done - Client does not want a 12 week letter sent to gp. looking forward to course though\n1/23/24 17:03: Hi Darragh   Hope you're well. As requested please see below for my start weight and week 2 weight. As discussed in our introductory call  I do not consent to share these details with my GP.  Should you need to send information for the purposes of commissioning then I do consent to sending the GP a figure for total weight change (without giving start and end weight)  and confirmation of attendance.  Week 1  16.01.24 - 21st 2lb Week 2  23.01.24 - 20st 13lb With thanks Alison \n2/27/24 17:49: Hi Darragh   Just a note to say thank you for your support thus far  and to wish you all the best in whatever you're moving on to. I very much appreciate that you have never been judgemental or patronising during sessions  and have always been supportive and open.  Good luck with your next steps  and thank you again.  Best wishes Alison \n3/7/24 14:11: Client emailed me and left a voicemail: Dear Sarah   Thank-you for your email this morning advising the new schedule of session leads. I have left you a voicemail and requested a callback to discuss however  as I am really very disappointed that we are going to have three different people leading the remaining five sessions. From brief conversation with several other participants I am not alone in this disappointment. I will speak for myself and only reference them in a general way as I have not discussed with them whether to speak on their behalf  but please know that my sentiments are reflected by other members of the group. On being invited to participate in this group I was anxious as to who would be running it; like many people who have been very overweight for a long time I have experienced being patronised  judged and insulted by people including health professionals and I am now mistrustful of speaking about my weight even with those who are supposed to help. When Darragh emailed us to introduce himself I googled him to understand who we would be running the group such was the anxiety  and honestly my participation hinged to a great degree on trusting who was leading it. I was reassured to a great extent by his introductory phone call  and as the weeks went on it was clear that he was a supportive  non-judgemental figure. Because of this he has had great success in encouraging me  and other group members  to engage in the programme and in the discussions with the honesty and openness that we are asked for as part of our participation in order to achieve the results that we all hope to. It is an unwritten but critical element of the contract between yourselves as an organisation and group members.  Now we are being asked to continue to participate with openness and honesty guided by three different people that we don't know  that we have no trusting relationship with  and for the part of the course that will be addressing the cognitive aspects of weight management which for some people  including myself  may bring up uncomfortable memories  thoughts and feelings. I would suggest that most of the people taking part in the group will have been very overweight for a very long time  and if learning about calorie counting was all that we needed to lose weight then we would all have been a healthy weight years ago. Most of us will have tried it  and most of us are actually benefitting from an ongoing relationship with a lead that gives support and provides the opportunity for weekly accountability - to an individual  not a link to a form. Most of us will really need this next part of the course to be delivered well in order to create and entrench behaviour change. I appreciate that people may leave jobs and we all very much wished Darragh the best on his departure  but is already unsettling to have to navigate the change from one lead to another and to be switching between three people in five weeks seems truly inappropriate.  As well as issues around a lack of trusting relationship it feels  to borrow a phrase from another group member  as though this is a tick box exercise by MoreLife to get the course completed. Like others I am concerned about the sense of continuity between sessions  and who we can reach out to for additional support between sessions if we need it. I would also note that there are group members who have identified themselves as being neurodivergent and there may well be additional impact on some of those members with these constant changes. None of this has been addressed or acknowledged in your email to us this morning  not even an apology for the disruption caused or an invitation to contact someone with any questions.    I anticipate that you will respond to me telling me that it is unfortunate but unavoidable  that there are issues with staffing levels and availability  and likely some kind of reassurance that all of your colleagues are caring and well trained and all able to deliver the programme. Unfortunately though corporate reassurances cannot replace relationships. It matters who runs the sessions  human connection matters. I hope that you will reconsider the scheduling for staffing the remainder of the course. I assume that I am not the only person who has waited over a year for this opportunity  having needed it for many more years before it was even offered  only to be deeply disappointed with this plan for delivery. I look forward to hearing from you. With regards Alison \n3/7/24 14:12: emailed client back: Hello Alison  I’m so sorry that it’s taken so long to get back to you. This is our first week without Darragh  and as a very small team we have been extremely busy delivering groups. I did get your voicemail  but not until it was too late to respond as I was out delivering groups in Basildon on both Tuesday and Wednesday. My apologies. I spoke to Emily yesterday afternoon and she mentioned to me that you had concerns around consistency of practitioners. She’s currently looking into options to address your concerns. In the meantime I think a phonecall would be best to talk about your worries and concerns. Would you be free for a call tomorrow at all? On Fridays I work 8am-4pm. I could be free to talk at any point in that window. If that doesn’t work for you  I’m sure we can come up with an alternative time. \n3/8/24 12:13: No reply to email so I called and left the following message on voicemail. I used Microsoft word dictate to record accurately what I said: Hello this is Sarah Thorpe and this is a message for Alison. I'm really sorry I haven't been able to get hold of you until now and I'm sorry that I couldn't respond as quickly as I'd have liked you. I did get your e-mail on Tuesday and read your concerns and unfortunately I wasn't able to respond until yesterday due to group delivery but I wanted to give you a call just because it's clear that you feel quite strongly about the points you raisewd in your email. Emily did contact me as well after your Tuesday session to relay the same concerns I just wanted to assure you that we are doing the best we can to minimise the disruption to your group. Obviously Darragh did leave and that is unfortunate but unavoidable  but it would be best to have the same practitioner for all your remaining sessions. We do strive to do that but we are a small service with just myself and another practitioner delivering sessions right now and so it's just not possible in some cases. There is another practitioner down to deliver your group from another area next week  that’s Matthew. We're looking into seeing if he could cover the rest of your sessions. At the moment we're not sure it does involve some moving around some other commitments and there’s other groups so can’t guarantee anything at this point. But we are  endeavouring to minimise the disruption tier group because I really do understand that it's not ideal. I'm sorry I haven't caught you on the phone yet  but hopefully this message does explain things. Do feel free to give me an e-mail or call and I'm very sorry if I'm a little late in responding to some of the messages going forward. As I say we've got a fair amount of groups to deliver here but I will get back to you soon as I can. OK have a nice day Alison and I hope you have a nice weekend too. thanks bye.\n3/19/24 10:11: PCS REQUESTED\n6/14/24 14:13: Alison called absolutely furious - email sent to DP) - who has informed me that she has just seen from her GP records that we have sent them information regarding her weight and that she told us explicitly that she didn’t want us to share this information with them. Alison informed me that on 23.1.24 she told Darragh both verbally and in writing that ‘as discussed in our introductory call I do NOT consent to share these details with my GP (These details relate to start/end weights) – should you need to send information for the purposes of commissioning then I do consent to giving GP total weight loss without giving start/end weights. Alison is very upset that we have breached her data protection rights and her trust. Alison wants information deleted that she says we can’t be trusted to keep private. \n6/14/24 14:55: I spoke with Alison  she would like her weights to be removed from our system - i have asked her to email to confirm this  i text her my email address. She would also like us to write to her GP to ask them to destroy the 12 week letter that was sent to them. She would also like us to report this to the ICO  i said that i would report this to the data protection officer in MoreLife and they can look into this  and can get back to her on the phone or in writing. Alison requested the outcome to be sent to her in writing. I then spoke with Kathryn Marshall  Kathryn has asked me to send across Allison's details and Kathryn will write to Allison.  \n6/24/24 12:24: PCS REQUESTED FOR WEGOVY SCREENING\n7/10/24 11:07: 30 day wegovy letter sent cc client\n7/10/24 11:16: Good afternoon Claire  We spoke to Alison for consent before replying to your previous request and she was unsure if she would like to proceed with this and we have left it with her to consider?

I am aware that COVID19 brings a number of both known and unknown risks. I have chosen to attend during the pandemic in the knowledge that there is still a risk of contracting the virus. I understand the coronavirus that causes COVID19 has a long incubation period during which time carriers of the virus may not show symptoms yet still be highly infectious. I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID19 or possibly infectious. I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a preexistent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat Yes Q19. I can confirm that I have not been in close contact of anyone suffering with any of these symptoms in the last 10 days. Yes\n9/8/23 13:58: I tried to call but for a long time it would not connect on either landline or mobile. Eventually started to ring on landline but then said line was busy. cannot leave a voicemail. Have already texted and emailed.\n9/11/23 14:24: Alice texted today that she has been out of the country. She arrived back later than expected and so missed session 1. She will attend next week.\n9/15/23 14:45: recap email sent to all clients: Hello  Please find information below on what was covered during session 1. If you missed the session it’ll help you catch up. If you were there  it’s just a handy recap. We want to firstly welcome you to MoreLife  we look forward to supporting you during this amazing journey. The sessions are designed to give you a greater understanding of how to manage your weight realistically and sustain long term weight loss. Our programme includes 12 weekly sessions which are 1 hour and a half duration along with 8 monthly follow up sessions lasting 1 hour.  We would like to direct you to your handbook to pages 1-19 are relevant to our first session (section 1: getting started) – I would encourage you to take some time to fill out page 8 – ‘why now’  think about/answer questions on pages 9-10 too. It may also be beneficial to make a note of your starting weight/measurements on page 12 and keep a record of your monitoring progress each week. Page 13 is about setting goals – have a think about if you have any long-term goals and make a note of these.  You’ll also set a weekly goal every week. But week 1’s goal is always the same – Keep a food diary! We recommend keeping a food diary throughout the programme to help maintain awareness  you can record a food diary in different ways (we discussed the various methods in our session: apps for example My Fitness Pal which is FREE to download  or My net diary  or (if you want a paid app) Nutracheck  phone notes  pictures  electronic/written diaries etc.) The format is far less important than the accuracy. Pick something you think is doable for you. I’ve attached some bits that may prove useful. If you’d like a food diary template one is attached. But you don’t have to use it. You can keep a food diary in whatever way works for you. I’ve also attached a sheet for you to record your goals week by week. You can use this if you like. Some people prefer to write their goals on their weight recording sheet. Again  whatever works. Lastly  you should have received a log in for an online platform called ‘mylifeplan’. This is our digital platform. I encourage you to log in to this. It’s got several videos and resources on there  and every week that you log in you unlock some new content. If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact with me via e-mail  call and text ?  My best wishes for a great week and I’ll see you all next week!

I have heard nothing further since that date and my own doctors have not been contacted by the More Life since the call I had with Claire M. I am now on Metformin and Canagliflozin for my diabetes instead of the oral version of Semaglutide and the Diabetes specialist  Claire Boston  at my GPs surgery (The Puzey Family practice reception.mailboxF81007@nhs.net) has today confirmed that as I'm now only on  Metformin and Canagliflozin for my Diabetes  I will now be able to safely take Wegovy for weight management. Claire M did say she would reconsider prescribing Wegovy for me if my Diabetic medication changed  so given that I am no longer on the Semaglutide tablets  I would really appreciate it if you would ask Claire M or the Wegovy doctor to prescribe the Wegovy injections for me now. Please let me know if this is possible.  Many thanks Vanessa Smith forwarded to CMk & RB\n4/17/24 8:52: Called client now eligable as has stopped taking oral semagluatide  has a review with PN at their surgery and this was stopped in view of wanting to start weygovy  discussed side effects again had initial assessment on the 6/3/24 and feel confident in what we spoke about has zoom session booked for the 24th of april.

Many thanks Vanessa Smith  // Good morning Vanessa  The survey has been sent earlier due to Christmas and New Year holidays to avoid delays in prescribing.

I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms.

I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a preexistent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat Yes Q19.

Charles is just generally unhappy being the size he is. looking forward to starting on the programme.\n9/15/23 14:45: recap email sent to all clients: Hello  Please find information below on what was covered during session 1. If you missed the session it’ll help you catch up. If you were there  it’s just a handy recap. We want to firstly welcome you to MoreLife  we look forward to supporting you during this amazing journey. The sessions are designed to give you a greater understanding of how to manage your weight realistically and sustain long term weight loss. Our programme includes 12 weekly sessions which are 1 hour and a half duration along with 8 monthly follow up sessions lasting 1 hour.  We would like to direct you to your handbook to pages 1-19 are relevant to our first session (section 1: getting started) – I would encourage you to take some time to fill out page 8 – ‘why now’  think about/answer questions on pages 9-10 too. It may also be beneficial to make a note of your starting weight/measurements on page 12 and keep a record of your monitoring progress each week. Page 13 is about setting goals – have a think about if you have any long-term goals and make a note of these.  You’ll also set a weekly goal every week. But week 1’s goal is always the same – Keep a food diary! We recommend keeping a food diary throughout the programme to help maintain awareness  you can record a food diary in different ways (we discussed the various methods in our session: apps for example My Fitness Pal which is FREE to download  or My net diary  or (if you want a paid app) Nutracheck  phone notes  pictures  electronic/written diaries etc.) The format is far less important than the accuracy. Pick something you think is doable for you. I’ve attached some bits that may prove useful. If you’d like a food diary template one is attached. But you don’t have to use it. You can keep a food diary in whatever way works for you. I’ve also attached a sheet for you to record your goals week by week. You can use this if you like. Some people prefer to write their goals on their weight recording sheet. Again  whatever works. Lastly  you should have received a log in for an online platform called ‘mylifeplan’. This is our digital platform. I encourage you to log in to this. It’s got several videos and resources on there  and every week that you log in you unlock some new content. If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact with me via e-mail  call and text ?  My best wishes for a great week and I’ll see you all next week!

She is still very much in the contemplation stage where she wants to restrict as she struggles to eat healthy when there are bad foods involved. We discussed starting with regular eating as she shared she does not normally eat breakfast or lunch. We set a goal to try and eat breakfast and or lunch for one day over the next two weeks. Shes very much worried about her health and feeling quite anxious as one of her friends husband passed away last week and he was very overweight and had very similar health problems.\n11/18/22 0:00: Session 3 of BE Programme.

Due to low self esteem found it challenging to write the positives about herself. We discussed this is an area she might need to revisit or speak to someone close. Although it has been an emotional week due to her mum's anniversary of her death she has still stayed on track with changing her eating patters. She is aware she is binging less due to eating during the day and has maintained this even though she is having an emotional week. We discussed support around her and the different type she has around her. She mentioned she needs someone who is firm but kind. We discussed how she can create this by either speaking to someone and having the support/accountability or speaking to her husband about this this session and showing where she is lacking. I have sent her information for therapy support incase she wants to discuss anything else.\n12/21/22 0:00: Session 5 of Binge Eating programme completed- Found this session the most challenging.

Has started to weigh herself again and we discussed where the restriction and negative thoughts can become more of a focus from this. We discussed different way this can be prevented and how she can control this. For example asking her husband to hide the scales choosing which days she will weigh and if she can keep monitoring her feelings emotions and mental wellbeing too. We discussed her long and short term goals and how she can keep incorporating this into her life and keep her focused. Has started a new hobby which is helping her mentally.

But tried to stay with in My calories as best I could.  I don't understand how iv put on that much.  Im so dissapointed with myself.    See you tonight.    Angela.  \n2/13/24 17:22: Hi Angela   How many days did you manage to calorie count and how many of the days did you stay in your ranges for a deficit? It is a consistency game but as long as we can reflect and learn from this week we can aim to make improvements for the weeks to come. Also do you currently have any goals set that you are aiming to achieve each day?   Kindest regards  \n2/13/24 17:22: Hi darragh   I callorie counted for all of them apart from one day.  Well so I thought  ...clearly not counted as well as I thought.   Iv had no take aways. Every meal has been home cooked.   Breakfast is always porridge and a banana.  Lunch is either an omelette or sandwich. Or soup.  Then dinners have all been cooked from fresh.  I have eaten alot of carbs. Although within my calories.  I no that shouldn't matter if within a deficit.   Iv defiantly gone wrong some where.    Iv been using my fitness pal to log everything  and I'm always with in My allowance.  But clearly I'm missing something  ?   Maybe I need to logg everything on a diary as well as my fitness pal   All I can do is see how I get on this week.  Thank you  Angela  \n2/16/24 12:23: Hi darragh.   Thank you for checking in.  That's nice of u.  This week seems to feel better. I'm logging literally everything   I hope its helped.  Last week I deffo over ate. I seemed to be really hungry last week. I think it's coz I didn't bulk my meals out with alot of veg or fruit.  So I found myself picking more.  So this week iv upped my veg and fruit  and water intake.  So fingers crossed   Iv bought a 2lt bottle aswell  so I can increase my fluids.  Also iv started doing the exercise videos. Iv planned to do this 3x a week  although there 40min videos and I really struggled. So I may break that down in to smaller slots.  If this hasn't worked this week then I think a 121 would be a good idea   I'll see how I go Thurs and weighing.  I'm so tempted to jump on the scales early. But holding out.  Honestly I don't know wot more I can do   Thank u for emailing me Angela   \n2/23/24 14:48: Morning darragh   Hope u ok.  I stayed the same again this week.  To he honest iv not been 100% iv been to a party with buffet food. And also iv had a mcdonalds.  Iv kept to calories where I can on other days.  I'll send over a food diary later today.

It was due to be delivered before I went on holiday  I contacted Claire McKee a good few days before I left for my holiday and advised her that I needed it to be delivered before I left as no one would be in to accept the package  but for some reason the new prescription wasn't ordered in time so the delivery didn't arrive before I left for my holiday.

He reports that when things are going well he will get a takeaway as a reward. He reports feeling disheartened and angry at himself for putting on so much weight after loosing weight in the past.

He reported that he didn't feel comfortable seeing a therapist as it would bring up past issues he wasn't comfortable with recalling. He said he would feel better in therapy if he didn't live on his own. I informed him that some of the stuff in the sessions could potentially trigger some feelings and that if he didn't feel comfortable to let me know and we could reassess whether it is the right time to do the programme.\n12/13/22 0:00: Had session 1 of BED intervention with client today.

This may go into your junk mail or spam so please keep an eye out for it. During the Zoom sessions we recommend having cameras switched on to enable you to interact with your practitioner and the other participants  if you have any concerns with having your camera switched on during the group sessions  please do speak with your practitioner.  If you have any other questions or queries  please do not hesitate to contact either myself or your practitioner. Best wishes \n1/15/24 19:32: call done - regarding mental health client thinks this is related to weight and wants to start course first before exploring any potential external support.\n2/6/24 17:19: Hi Darragh  Unfortunately  my weight today is 158.4kg. I am not happy  but I do know why because I have been stress eating a lot over the weekend and night times for an important exam today. I did stick to my calories limit during the day but it's when I'm studying I have the munchies.  Also  I might be late for today's session because I'm traveling to the Exam Centre.  Allen \n2/27/24 17:46: Hi Darragh  My weight today is 155.4kg. I was naughty for an engagement party over the weekend. But I'm concerned that my weight is not reducing even with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. In the past I know I used medication to support like Saxenda and Orsilat. Would that be beneficial to me at this stage  or I can be referred for this? I know I mentioned that my weight does bother my mental health and I think recently it has been bothering me a whole lot. In the past I know when I did things like this I had significant weight loss and I guess comparing those past results have me really low mood. Also  before you handover  you did mention the criteria for the weight loss surgery but what's the actual process. Do I have to complete this programme and then put on a waiting list? Anything for my GP to do? Kind regards  Allen \n3/4/24 15:36: pcs requested\n3/12/24 11:47: Good Afternoon This patient left the surgery in January 2023.

However  I’m thinking if they delivered to no 18 it would have been ok as its his neighbour next door  but seems to have been sent somewhere completely different. See emails from the client below. Could you look into this please and let me know solution? Many thanks. Have a good day Claire ? Hello Claire  I just wanted to report that Royal Mail delivered the items to the wrong address. I don't even know where it was delivered because the driver says neighbour but I live in a block of flats and this is a house.  Regards  Richardson Allen Hi Claire  Sorry I forgot to attached proof of the wrong address the medication being delivered to. I also walked around the neighbourhood and all the doors that are 18 doesn't look like that picture. The tracking info was linked to my RoyalMail app so if the courier had any issues  there's information to contact me as well as a camera doorbell.  I am just disappointed that it's two days they kept messaging that it was going to be delivered and  in the end  it was delivered to an address out of the area.  Thanks  Richardson Allen \n4/8/24 8:33: Hello Claire  I'm a little confused because once again the medication was not delivered. My home address is Flat 24 Vantage Court  14 Kenway Southend-on-Sea SS2 5DX so not sure where the medication is going? Regards  Allen  \n4/10/24 9:06: Incorrect delivery address: Contacted Craig O'toole/Ranjana and Kathryn Marshall. Parcel cannot be collected by Chemist4U Hi    Thank you for the email. I've looked into this  and we wouldn't be able to arrange a collection from an address without the occupants knowing we have arranged this. This will cause confusion if Royal Mail turn up for a collection and the people don't know who live there. I've checked the GPS of both deliveries  and I can see the buildings are very close to each other as you can see in the image below. I replied requesting next steps now medication is at the wrong address - awaiting response. HAve documented as a near miss on our system. KM advises all medication should be signed for and can be delivered to work addresses if delivered in this way to avoid medication being left outside clients homes 'safe places'\n4/10/24 9:12: See attached dietetic notes.\n4/10/24 9:31: Checked with client- attended information session.\n4/11/24 11:43: GP LETTER SENT\n4/25/24 10:10: called client  on second doesage of weygovy  no real issues some loud bowels sounds/ gas but no pain  has not lost weight but said has had a few social events recently.

Best wishes \n1/10/24 18:10: Engagement call done\n1/30/24 15:20: Hi Darragh   Thank you very much for calculating this calories for me.  So in order to loose weight I should be somewhere between 1200 and 1521 calories/ day  right?  I am thinking to try calories counting as I've never done it before and I know I have to do bigger changes to get better results. I wil do this as main choice but will also work on eating mindfully and whenever I can't scan the barcodes I will apply portion control. Sounds interesting the hand measuring. Is this a good plan? What do you think?  I've started to use the My fitness pall app and to scan the barcode of what I eat. I feel I need time to get used to it. Another thing is that now I have to take the phone with me to the kitchen to scan the barcodes ?. I started to work on being more mindful while eating and  I left my phone in my bedroom when going in the kitchen to eat. But will scan the barcodes and I'll be a good girl ??Will put it aside while eating to give this time to myself just for eating.  There are lot of things I need to work on and to change. I don't realy have a routine  I don't have those 3 main meals/day with snacks in between. My sleeping is also all over the place  being in lot of pain and very exhausted and short of breath many times I am glad  I can get some sleep when I can that being day or night. My eating times are also orchestrated by this issues. I use to sleep till 12 -1 pm so I don't really have breakfast time.  Another thing is that I can't exercise as I would like to. I have from phisyo bed and sitting exercises. I know compared to times when I couldn't exercise at all it is something but I would like to be able to do much more. Hopefully in time I'll get there. Another problem I have is with nutrition as many times I am thinking what to eat. I know my liver enzymes are  a bit elevated and I am on pretty much medication (opioids for pain management) but it looks like whatever I eat I don't feel well after eating; very bloted  like pumped up  can't breath  can't find a comfortable position in bed somehow  more exhausted and sleepy and I put on about 2-3 kg after a normal meal (like water retention ??? or I don't know what is it ???). Honestly I feel better if I don't eat but I need to live with something  I need to eat something. Because I can't cook I buy ready meals and warm it in micro (which isn't really healty). I found small portions (I never eat to be  full) of milk and porridge or wetabix  seeded wholemeal toast bread and boiled fresh meat being ok to have  that won't make me feel so very bad after eating. Still bloated but not that realy bad like after a cooked meal. Does other people with long covid have this issue feeling worse after eating and do you know what is the cause of it? Could you please help me about this issues? I really don't know what to eat ???   I am trying to have fruits (not sweet ones) and I am thinking about juicing as I really don't know what to do and how to sort out this issue with eating and feeling worse after it. But not sure with juicing if I'll have enough energy   if I'll be well enough to be consistent with doing it and I need to learn how to combine them  how to do it. I've not done it before.Maybe when I can I do it when not  not ?. Also what do I do about proteins with juicing? What do you think about it?  I know when I am in a flare up I am in very much pain and very exhausted so for few days I only drink fluids like water  sips of milk  milky decaff coffee  sips of orange juice maybe  and slep sleep sleep as even eating and digestion is too much effort to do.  From your experience have you met people with such issues before and what would help? I heard you speaking with the others during last session about curry rice  pasta  lasagne  and I was just thinking when was the last time I aet such things? To me such things are like poison not food and I don't understand why. I know my liver enzymes are little elevated but GP said that's ok  nothing to worry or to do about it. I also had bloods done and it's not autoimune disease. Thank you for allowing us to have the video off sometimes during our zoom sessions. I find it hard to sit on the chair at my desk for 1hour 30 minutes and I get pretty exhausted and in pain so sometimes I have to come to bed to lay down. Also because of brain fog issues I find it hard sometimes to concentrate for long periods of time  it gives me headache and I can't remember words that's why I don't really speak much and I preffer using the chat to answer your questions. But I am trying my best to learn as much as I can and to work actively on loosing weight.  The respiratory consultant advised I need bariatric surgery and sent a letter to my GP about it but I don't consider it best option and I would avoid it; what you cut out cut out remains for ever  you can't put it back after.  I've also been contacted from More Life about screening for Saxenda injections and GP done the bloods and sent over the results. I was told I qualify for it but last time I phoned to ask if I could speak with a Dr about it I was told I should first start the online sessions and during the program I should speak with my coach about it. Of course I want to learn lifestyle changes and a healthy way of eating as for long term I think this is the best option but I am also opened to other options (surgery being last one on the list) if that's what I need and what would help me.  I am sharing this with you so you can get to know me better and the issues I am dealing with and also because I know I need help regarding this stubborn morbid obesity I've got to somehow come out of it as I don't want to get complications and more health issues from it.  As a note I want to let you know when we started the program and I sent you my first weight values I was on my period and I ussualy gain weight with it. So last week  the second values I sent was about 1.5 kg less but as you know that wasn't actually fat loss (I wish it would be ?????) but probably water retention loss related to being after my period. Just feel I need to share this with you as you probably wondered what have I done that works so well... 1 5 kg lost in one week. ???  Thank you very much for everything you do to help us  for being there for us. Your efforts  help and support are much appreciated!  Kind regards   Ligia.  \n3/4/24 15:24: pcs requested\n3/11/24 11:37: Good afternoon    Thank you for your email.

I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID-19 or possibly infectious. I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID-19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a pre-existent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat Yes Q19.

To be honest  I didn't think the program will take this long to complete also thought the injection would be readily available.  I am already doing more or less everything in the book and nothing's changed much.\n10/26/23 7:50: To Tutu 26/10/2023 Hello Tutu   You’re more than welcome  I completely understand  unfortunately with the worldwide shortage of saxenda we are unable to prescribe Saxenda on out programme additionally Saxenda has very strict eligibility criteria. So  once supplies resume  you’d still only be able to get Saxenda under NICE guidelines if ALL THREE of the following applied: •\tYou have a BMI of above 35 •\tYou have non-diabetic Hyperglycaemia – That is an HbA1c reading of 42-47 or a fasting blood glucose level of 5.5-6.9 without diabetes (pre-diabetic individuals) •\tYou have another cardiovascular risk factor e.g. High Blood pressure or High Cholesterol. In regards to Wegovey we are aiming to have this medication in our services however we are not certain when this will be available at this current point in time.  However  if you were prescribed this medication on our services  you would need to attend a minimum of 10 out of the 12 weekly sessions and 4 out of the 8 monthly sessions to still be prescribed.  With your journey is there anything that you are particularly struggling with? \n2/28/24 14:15: pcs requested\n3/11/24 12:47: PCS REQUESTED FOR THIRD TIME CC CLIENT NOTING NHS APP \n3/13/24 14:17: called GP PCS to be sent asap\n3/14/24 9:24: pcs uploaded eligible for wegovy\n3/14/24 10:06: Hi I tried to call you to book your Wegovy (weight loss Medication) Assessment with Dr McKee.

Best wishes \n1/11/24 15:46: engagement call done - mh related to weight  wants to start sessions then update me if she needs any support \n2/9/24 13:29: Morning Darragh  Another mixed bag from me this week  I’m afraid. Weight hasn’t moved - still 19st 12lb. But to be fair and totally honest  I haven’t been calorie counting at all. This Covid has really knocked us so with all of us down with it  it’s been a matter of eating when and whatever we could  and keeping it as easy as possible so everyone at least ate. I also just had no energy for cooking separate meals or lots of shopping so just did whatever worked. Not ideal when you should be watching what you eat but I figured  like you said previously  it was one week out of all the weeks and I could improve things when I felt better. I’m glad to say  I think I’m over the worst of it so the next week should be easier  and I’m happy that at least I haven’t gained. Exercise wise  my first goal was to wear my Apple Watch every day and start tracking my ‘rings’ so I had a baseline to improve on. I actually originally bought the watch so it was easier for me to phone for help if the dog had a hypo so I only ever wore it on dog walks. But I’ve worn it all day every day this week and my average is 14 mins exercise  400 calories  14 stand  6185 steps. I’ve found by wearing it  I’ve wanted to close the rings so I’ve improved as the week’s gone on. Today I’ve increased the goals slightly so that next week I’ll do more. I’ve researched some exercise classes in the area  and I’m interested in one  but it’s about finding the time because as you know  I’m responsible for my mum and dog and very limited in free time. When my son is back from uni in June  that will be easier for me. In the meantime  now I’m over the Covid  I plan to try and incorporate some at home exercises so I’ll let you know how that goes next week. Speak later  Sally. \n2/9/24 13:32: 1 to 1 carried out with Sally. Current lifestyle  caring for mother and also her dog  has 2 autistic children in their 20s  she has to do jobs for them like ironing cooking meals and they will have different meals. sally is very educated in regards to nutrition  she doesn't feel she eats poorly she doesn't drink or eat between meals. we discussed some goals for her to implement as this is where she feels she has no motivation because she had nothing in place. 3 goals she came up with was to drink more water  she does not like cold water so going to fill a bottle of room temp. going to try and do a youtube exercise video and also continue to walk her dogs 2x a day. lastly to bulk meals with salad on the ide and reduce overall portions.\n2/23/24 14:45: Morning Darragh  Scales flitting between 19st 10lb and 19st 9lb today. It’s been a very busy week so not much to report. I’ve stuck with my promises though and am hitting my new watch targets  doing a session of Joe Wicks weekly  drinking more water and bulking up with salad and vegetables. My foot has held up on medication  although it’s not particularly comfortable so I’ve not introduced strollercise yet or increased my at home sessions. I think I’ll have to do this gradually as I can’t be in a position where I can’t function as those I care for obviously rely on me so it’s a nightmare if I’m out of action. I’ve not started batch cooking but I am consciously not cooking excess food - eg. I’ve reduced the size of the mince I buy from 750g to 500g and/or freezing the extra piece of food in the pack rather than just cooking and eating it anyway.

Just confirm prescription is being made same day with Claire when you have your appointment. If you let me know nearer the time we can send the prescription out prior to your holiday. Hope this helps Claire Hi Claire  Sorry to bother you again but I emailed the wegovy team and haven’t had a reply. Do you mind just confirming my dates/timetable are still ok as I’m a little worried it’s cutting things a bit fine between finishing a pen and receiving a new prescription. I had my initial prescribing appointment on 17/4/24 and took my first dose of wegovy on 24/4/24 straight after the education session. All of my booked appointments with the prescribing nurse/consultant endocrinologist are scheduled to occur after I have taken my 4th dose and my pens are completely finished so I’m aware there is a very short window for the new pen to be delivered and I just wanted to confirm this is the norm and ok? 1st pen finishes 15/5/24 - appointment on 16/5/24 - next dose due 22/5/24 2nd pen finishes 12/6/24 - appointment on 13/6/24 - next dose due 19/6/24 3rd pen finished 10/7/24 - appointment on 11/7/24 - next dose due 17/7/24 4th pen finished by 7/8/24 - appointment on 8/8/24 - next dose due 14/8/24 5th pen finished by 4/9/24 - appointment on 5/9/24 - next dose due 11/9/24 I’m also going on holiday from 3/8/24 - 17/8/24 inclusive so although I will still be able to have my telephone appointment  I will not be able to take delivery of my new pen which will obviously be needed. Can you help with this  please? Thanks Claire. Kind regards  Sally\n5/1/24 10:41: See attached dietetic assessment notes.\n5/8/24 7:47: Sorry to bother you Claire  I wasn’t sure who to contact. If it’s not you  I apologise and would ask if you could forward my email as appropriate.

Hi  I am getting better. I still am on a lot of calcium supplements and have had an ultrasound that shows a fatty liver. I am desperately becoming more confused with what food I can eat and what I should avoid as I'm getting scared of causing more harm. Can you help do you think?\n9/28/23 11:04: Asked RB for advice on this client. Have asked client what surgery they have had  so it can be determined if she is still suitable to start the GSH Binge Eating Intervention. Have advised client to speak to GP or hospital about more tailored nutrition advice on their newly diagnosed health condition.\n9/28/23 15:43: Client responded to message. The operation they had done was a total thyroidectomy on the 17th of July.

Thanks for your assistance  Vicky  - - - passed on to Liz for online platform to be sent across\n1/12/24 14:27: Confirmation email sent to Vicky - link for MLP also sent\n1/30/24 15:33: Hi Darragh  Weekly weigh in as requested: 10.01.24- 18.11 17 01.24-18.9 24.01.24- 18.6 This week has been ok  end of the month so waiting for payday after Xmas meant using up food from the cupboard so not as much fruit as I'd usually have. On a couple of side notes- I've had a total thyroidectomy and a prolonged stay in hospital after complications- I get quite anxious around food now as I want to make sure I'm not unhealthy. They also diagnosed a fatty liver but it's so mild they said if I keep going it will correct itself. Do we cover the amount of saturated fat we can eat? I use fitness pal so stay in the ranges of the macro there but just wanted to check. I also wondered what we do about holiday? I've been on the waiting list for a year so have a holiday booked for june plus have half term in Feb  with the kids at home I won't be able to attend as they are to small to be left alone. I'm absolutely determined to do this so just wondered if I can be accommodated at all? Also  in case you wonder why my camera is off during the session- my signal is shocking and you freeze every time I turn my camera on. Apologies for that. Sorry for the ramble but I just wanted to inform you and ask a couple of questions. Have a good day! Vicky Cline  \n2/23/24 15:38: missed session 6 and potential 7-  Hi  Just to let you know that I won't be there tomorrow as I am away with the kids as it is half term.

I take Propranolol for my migraines which started in February 2023  so I’ve had to increase my dose every couple of months. I’ve had a look on my patient record on system online but it doesn’t show my diagnosis of migraines  it just shows the dates I’ve been prescribed my medication. Is this something you require? If so  I will need to contact my GP and obtain a letter/confirmation for you  which may take a few weeks!

I attended my first session and the gentleman hosting it  was an old teacher of mine who I currently have on social media  which gave me major anxiety to even turn my camera on (which he kindly asked of us) I didn't attend my 2nd session as my anxiety too over in case he recognises me. Is there anything that can be done?\n8/8/24 8:07: Reply to Chantelle - Hi Chantelle  The only option is to put you back on the waiting list for a programme with a different practitioner.

It's nothing against Matt but it's triggering my anxiety and not allowing me to feel I can participate as I should be if I know the person leading it - REPLY - Hi Chantelle Yes that's all been done for you.

Yours Sincerely MoreLife Team\n12/12/24 10:26: Hi  I’ve had a referral for Bariatric surgery and was told I needed to complete the weight management programme. I was told after my 6th weekly session  I will be contacted regarding WeGovy. I’ve finished my 12th weekly session and I’m due to start my monthly sessions on 18th December. I appreciate how busy you are but I’m just wondering if there’s an update as to when I should expect to hear something? During my weekly sessions  I went on holiday and tore the ligament in my knee so I was unable to walk and this slowed down any potential progress I was hoping for. My knee is a lot better now and I’ve signed up to the gym so I’m hoping to kick start this weight loss. Although with my PCOS diagnosis and Underactive thyroid  I’m finding dieting and exercise are just not helping or I’m seeing next to no results. Any update would be appreciated.

In order to check your eligibility  we need an up-to-date medical history and relevant blood results (please see further details below) dated within the last 12 months.   *In particular we need: •\tUp to date medication list •\tUp to date medical history (including surgical) •\teGFR •\tLipid profile •\tBlood pressure •\tHbA1c If you have not had the above tests in the last 12 months  please could you arrange these blood tests with your GP and please send us the results when available to claire.benson4@nhs.net If you have access to the NHS app then you should have access to this information directly  please send us your results to the following email address claire.benson4@nhs.net Unfortunately  without this information we are unable to assess your eligibility for Wegovy. Please do send this information across as soon as possible to the following email address claire.benson4@nhs.net Please note that our team will be working as quickly as possible to screen you for Wegovy  however please be aware that the outcome of the screening may take some weeks after you have initially started your weight management programme.

Please note below some of highlighted points- to try.  Also  please contact your NHS GP if symptoms (burps) persist. I shall call you for follow up on 17/18 March 2025 sulfur burps while taking Wegovy (semaglutide)  here are some management strategies to help reduce them: 1. Dietary Adjustments •\tAvoid sulfur-rich foods: Limit intake of eggs  garlic  onions  cruciferous vegetables (broccoli  cabbage  cauliflower)  and high-protein animal foods •\tLimit carbonated drinks: Sodas and sparkling water can introduce excess gas. •\tReduce sugar substitutes: Sorbitol  mannitol  and xylitol (found in sugar-free gum and diet products) can cause digestive issues. •\tEat slowly & chew thoroughly: This reduces swallowed air and improves digestion- Mindful eating 2. Optimize Gut Health •\tProbiotics: Taking probiotics or eating fermented foods (like low fat yogurt or kefir) may help balance gut bacteria and reduce gas production. •\tFiber intake: Gradually increase fiber to prevent constipation  which can worsen sulfur burps. •\tStay hydrated: Drink plenty of water  (1.5-2l/d)  reduce caffeine-try decaffeinated tea 3. Medication Considerations •\tAcid reflux treatment: If burps are accompanied by heartburn  talk to your NHS GP about antacids or acid reducers (e.g.  omeprazole or famotidine). 4. Wegovy-Specific Strategies •\tAdjust dosing time: If symptoms are worse at a certain time  consider changing when you take Wegovy (we can explore this in our next call). •\tMonitor portion sizes: Wegovy slows digestion  so eating smaller meals can reduce bloating and burping. •\tAssess for side effects: If symptoms persist or worsen- we shall review dosage – to be discussed in next call Thanking You Regards Dr Ranjana Babber  RD  PhD \n3/19/25 14:44: RB spoke to client and they said they have been presctibed omeprazole by their doctor and also using peppermint oil capsules  feels little better with wegovy side effcts- atleast lseeping through night   as they are going away from 20th April till 2may they feel it is better to reduce dosage to 1.7mg. RB shall request ZA (Pharmacist prescriber decision) & they can follow up with new provider for further titration- RB shall include note to call client on 3rd may in transfer notes\n3/19/25 14:48: Last dose of 2.4mg wegovy taken on 18/3/2025\n3/20/25 9:57: 2 x 1.7mg ",

Maybe they can print them off in the surgery and you can copy and email over?

Prescription complete \n3/13/24 14:30: Hi Claire I’ve just had my first phone session with another Claire. She has okayed me for the prescription and has said that I am not actually able to use it until I’ve had a first zoom session. The list you sent me regarding initial appointments has my next appointment on the 26th of March but it’s a phone call not zoom. The only mention of zoom is on the August appointment.  Please can you let me know when the zoom meeting is scheduled so that I know when I will be able to start using the medication. With regard to the appointments listed  can I make a request please?  I have two jobs  one is Monday Tuesday  Thursday Friday. The other is Wednesday the Wednesday job is paid hourly and if I am having appointments for 12 pm it means I’m losing a whole morning of money. (I already lose a morning for the Morelife zoom sessions ?) Is there anyway that my appointments could be set for 9:30 am? (The Claire that I have just spoken to said it would be okay for her to note my calls as 9:30 am). Also the calls scheduled for a Tuesday 26/3 and 27/8 - would there be much personal information required? (Tuesdays I work in an office with 4 male and 1 female members of staff).  Would it be possible to have those appointments as first calls? I can then make up time at end of day. Thanking you for this opportunity.

I noted my colleague has requested recent weight evidence already with you- we shall await the updated weight evidence for current month. I have also noted your request for sharps bin- Unfortunately  we cannot offer additional sharps bin. However  you can either contact your local pharmacy/ check with local council website for emptying sharps safely. You shall also be able to buy additional sharps bin at local pharmacy at a nominal price. Thanking You Best Wishes MoreLife Wegovy Team \n12/11/24 15:25: Hi  Please see attached new weight from Boots. Please note that it shows my weight has increased. Please note that I hadn’t taken my water tablet at that point and as mentioned previously during meetings I retain about 4 lb of water. Also note that when I did the previous weight in October it was warmer so I didn’t have to wear boots nor jumpers. Also  I did mention to Ms Bubba that there was a big difference in weight between my scales and the boot scales and I asked her which one to use she said that the boots ones were calibrated and that I should use that one. Having spoken to the staff in the boots shop this morning  they said that the machine had been fixed about two months ago which I’m assuming means that that weight was actually incorrect ??? I still feel happy myself in my weight loss journey and know that I am losing weight judging by clothes that are fitting me now that previously didn’t. Wishing you all a very happy Christmas and prosperous New Year. \n12/13/24 18:26: ZA requested  decision to prescribe 3 wegovy pens of 2.4mg  client has lost 9.9% weight loss at 9 month   2 kg up from 6 month review- client notified due to difference in weighing scale\n12/16/24 7:42: 3 x 2.4mg wegovy issued \n12/17/24 13:32: Hi My Wegovy arrived this morning at my house by Royal Mail.  As I have mentioned before  I work 5 days a week so will never be home to accept delivery of the parcel which advises me to put in fridge on receipt. Via ring doorbell  I asked postman to deliver it to my neighbour (who I could see was in) but was told he couldn’t do that as it needed to be signed for. Now the “chilled” Wygovy one will sit in the post  office (4 days) until Saturday  and like before the frozen packaging will melt all over the box! Surely it can be delivered to somewhere else - apparently neighbour nor my place of work (where I receive all parcels) are acceptable. What else am I supposed to do?  Kind regards A M Lentz  forwarded to RB and ZA\n12/24/24 9:59: RB spoke with client they have received their delivery for wegovy pen  and the package was still cold- dleivery man assured it was kept in cold place. Explained to check each penprior to use that medication is clear and coloulress- client agreed.  Client was concerned about weight measured at boots scale was slightly hogher as they got it recalibrated 3 months ago- explained weighing scales are periodically caliberated but happy to review weight loss trajectory when thye repeat weight at 12 monthr eview. RB has updated wegovy appointment sheet/ prescription monitoring to write prescription on FRiday so Delivery is SATURDAY\n3/6/25 14:50: Hi Claire   I have one more week left (Tuesday next week) of my current prescription.  Is there another set of pens being sent to me? Just checking as I’ve not heard anything. Kind regards A M Lentz  \n3/10/25 12:55: Hi Claire   It’s my last pen and I have one more injection from it (next Tuesday) I received 3 pens on 17th Dec 24 Kind regards A M Lentz  \n3/10/25 13:05: 12 month review booked 11/3 3pm\n3/11/25 14:32: 12 MONTH REVIEW CONDUCTED discussed with pt how they are getting on  injecting tuesday morning   2.4mg  0 left   lost 3 stone in total  benefits - clothes fit better- gone down 2 sizes  diet: batch cooks  plans all meals ahead  mobility is much better  no longer panting  no changes to dh  mh  consented to letting us know of any changes   blood test and weight noted - all good  side effects minimal and manageble - just getting a dry mouth at night  is drinking enough water no doses missed  pt consented to continue treatment 2.4mg x 2 pens issued\n3/17/25 9:23: My prescription arrived this morning via Royal Mail and I was not home to be able to accept the signed for delivery.  Chemist4you sees that it will be re-delivered to me tomorrow  again this won’t work because I work all day Friday I have asked via the app for Royal Mail to deliver on Saturday. Following a discussion with chemist4you this morning I was told that it is possible to have my prescription delivered to my work address as I work five days a week and I’m never home to be able to accept the signed for delivery of the medication.   By the time it gets to me  according to the operative I spoke to at chemist for you the medication has passed a certain timeframe they recommend. As you can see from the last paragraphs of her email  it is possible if you can change the address for delivery so that I may get it at my workplace. It’s a small office and I’m the office manager and accept all the parcel deliveries. She also advises that because arriving on Saturday will take it out of its time usage I will only be able to use two of the injections for one of the pens.  What happens now with regard to those two injections of which I will be short in the middle of May? Please advise. Thanks in advance.

What is your further advice as she has not followed the protocol and reported it after using higher dose.   Thanking You   Regards Ranjana Babber Hi I think she has to continue on the 0.5mg now she has started. Perhaps the easiest thing to do is bring her titration reviews forward by a week.  She completes 4 doses of 0.5mg and then we review re titration of dose. Claire. Are you able to change her FU appointments and bring forward by 1 week?

They said they were able to get back on track the next day  however they were still tough on themselves when reflecting on this.

Sorry.--- Unfortunately - not a good week and my weight is exactly the same @ 19 t 112 lb. It’s been a difficult and emotional week and I have been snacking big time in the evenings over 700 calories on 4 days hence the reason for not losing weight! I am certainly influenced by others in social environments and boredom eating and was in a bit of a vicious cycle of binge eating and guilt. Following on from last week I did do a foresight table/map  (Attached ) and was initially please with number of things I thought I was good at controlling but to be honest I was feeling so overwhelmed last weekend that I did’t look at it again until today and will set my goals a little kinder this week. I have a wake to got on Saturday but feel this is okay and am feeling positive about next week I have joined up for Cancer race( Walk) for life 5k in May as part of a group walking in honour of a close friend that died over Christmas  and although I don’t like walking it will be a nice challenge if I can stick to training plan! Over the last year I have really got into group exercise classes and miss it when I can’t go so there is hope for my health improvement!! Look forward to speaking to you tonight Lynda \n2/13/24 17:14: after session 5 - Hi Darragh I was a little disappointed that I stayed the same weight this week (19st 12) although I do know why - I had 4 days when I drank and/or ate snacks in evening and exceeding my calorie target! I feel as though I need to cut down alcohol volume on the occasions when I am socialising and my target this week is to refrain from casual drinking at home unless there are guests. Could you tell me my calorie target please. At moment I am going via my fitness pal which is a target of 1750. Also if I want to cut carbs to reduce my risk of diabetes should I aim for 100g or 150g of carbs /day? When I have looked on websites it ranges from 250g = normal to 20g for very strict keto - ( which I wouldn’t manage! ) and everything in-between. Not sure if you are going to be covering this tonight but is it possible to change calorie count during week to allow for a more social weekend? My goals this week are 1. Continue to eat at dining table on 4 days a week. 2. Continue to exercise class 2 times a week and one home video 3. Continue to use upstairs loo. 3. To only drink alcohol on Saturday ( I’m out) and on Sunday I will drive so no alcohol 4. To start reducing carbs to 150g / day. 5. To only snack - have fun food on 3 days Sunday and …. See you tonight \n2/13/24 17:15: sent to client - Hi Lynda Thank you for sending this update across. Alcohol can definitely put us over our calories very quickly  out of curiosity what do you tend to drink when you socialise? It can be part of a healthy balanced diet but it has to be in moderation. I tend to advise people to avoid casual drinking at home and to drink once a week ( if you have lots of social events) and aim to stick to non alcoholic drinks the rest of the time. We can also make better decisions when drinking in terms of calories. For example a vodka tonic or gin will be far less calories than a glass of wine. Im afraid I cant advise on specifics when it comes to your carbohydrate intake  this is definitely something you should discuss with either a specialist or your gp - we will talk about carbohydrates this evening but im afraid we don’t go into specifics regarding diabetes. We do have sessions for diabetes info that are run from time to time  if you think this would be helpful I can find out when the next sessions are and send this information across? I will get your calories worked out and sent across asap  and I do like the goals you have set ?. I will see you shortly. Kindest regards  \n2/23/24 14:34: Hi Darragh - sorry for late reply  I’m very please I have lost a little this week and now weigh 19 st 11 lb The habit session was quite useful and help me focus on my steps I need to take to achieve my goal rather than the end goal. I have started to read atomic habit by James Clear which is giving me a better insight into habit formation and although the reducing bad habits is hard  I am just trying the best I can. The other difference is lack of alcohol which is both saving me loads of calories and diminishing number of calories consumed as snack foods associated with the alcohol. - I am not confident on how long I will keep up thesis but we will see. As all or nothing thinking is definitely one of my downfalls so am concerned as to my what my behaviour will be like if I do drink alcohol! Lynda \n3/4/24 15:12: pcs requested\n3/25/24 14:01: Email from GP - Good afternoon   Thank you for your email.  Please see the information attached as requested.

Could let me know if I’m being considered or if there is anything else I can do to help this along please Many thanks Lynda Robinson Sent from my phone   Good morning Lynda Results came over end of last week  you are eligible and on the waiting list (I don't have a timescale as yet) Kind regards Claire \n4/12/24 10:46: Thanks Claire  Irony is just seen a letter this morning from gynaecologist who said I need to loose 10 st  and has refered me to a gynaecology weight loss appointment but that appointment is in November which is after his next consideration as to whether I will need surgery. I have 6 months to loose significant weight so am feeling desperate for help and my gp is so slow in responding to your request for info I missed out on this first tranche of Wegovy  All of this is out of my control all I can do is my best Sent from my phone Hi Lynda Please don't be too disheartened  reach out to your practitioner they will help support you whilst you are waiting.  You can still manage your weight by putting all the great advise from your sessions into practice. I know its not always easy but it will be worth it. I'll also speak to your practitioner and see if there's any further support we can offer in the mean time. Best wishes Claire \n4/15/24 8:24: Thanks for your understanding  Claire and sorry to be a pain- Can I just ask is delay going forward a timing issue due to drs availability etc or a funding issue? Also I have about £500 in savings - if I paid for Wegovy privately for a couple of months( assuming I can source it!) would this change my eligibility in any way - I can’t afford to fund any more than about 2 months so do you think that would be long enough? I’m finding it quite cruel that everyone in my support group are getting opportunities that I may not receive or can be part of with them  just because of timing of results from my gp. Lynda Sent from my phone\n4/15/24 8:27: Good morning Lynda  Unfortunately we couldn't screen for eligibility without the correct information from your GP.  If you self fund Wegovy it won't impact your eligibility as long as you still meet the criteria. I will let you know when I have more information on waiting times Lynda  I don't want to give you the wrong information. Hope this helps Claire \n4/18/24 11:40: due to drop out booked client in for wegovy assessment\n4/18/24 12:10: Confirmation letter/leaflet and PES sent to client\n4/19/24 9:17: weight uploaded 127.1\n4/22/24 10:25: added to scriptlink\n4/25/24 21:19: called client happy to talk with me attended PES yesterday on the 24/3/24  has read throught the patient information leaflet happy with side effects  no family history of thyriod cancer. bloods from march show HbA1C in diabetic range 50mmols  no diagnosis of diabetes advice that she needs to see GP  needs repeating to determine diagnosis if remains in diabetic range need retinal screening before prescribing \n4/29/24 9:22: Call from Lynda - she spoke to CK last week who said she would right to GP regarding their conversation. No notes recorded on here to that effect. Lynda asked if I could email notes that are on MCG so she has them for GP as she has appt today. Spoke with MB to said that this is ok\n5/7/24 9:44: forwarded to RH and RB for prescription - Hi Claire   I have managed to speak my GP and  without further blood tests  he decided that I am now a type 2 diabetic and because HbA1c level is only 50 mmol no medications are required.   My GP arranged for me to speak to a nurse but because she was unable to say how long it will take for NHS diabetic retinopathy screening results  I contacted the centre that organises this and she said it takes approx. 3 months before test can be done.   I therefore went to my opticians at boots and explained the problem and they very kindly have performed a thorough dilated retinal eye examination. The optician said explained their scanners were more detailed than the NHS screening ones. I am pleased to say that there was no indication retinopathy or maculopathy. See letter attached.   Moreover from the research I have completed the diabetes website (https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-complications/diabetic-retinopathy.html#google_vignette) and other sites  it says that rapid reduction of HbA1cwhich could make any diabetic retinopathy worse is defined as a drop in HbA1c of 30mmol/mol. I assume such a drop will be extremely unlikely in my case because my HbA1c is only 50.   In view of the above and as I really want to get into type 2 remission as early as possible and shift as much weight as quickly as possible (My gynaecologist has targeted me with a weight of 11 stone) I shall be very grateful if the doctor could reassess my suitability for a Wegovy prescription please.

GP referral Health Q4. Why do you want to lose weight at this time?

Exercise Meal Replacement i.e. Slimfast Slimming groups i.e. Weight Watchers  Slimming World Reducing Portion Reducing carbohydrates Q6. Were you successful? Yes No Q7.

If you are taking part in an online Zoom session  do you have a set of scales to weigh yourself at home? Yes Q17. The places on the course are very limited and if you begin the programme and drop out you may not be offered another course. We want you to have the best experience possible. Bearing this in mind is this the right time for you to join a group? Are you able to commit to at least 10 out of the 12 weekly sessions? Yes Q18. I am aware that COVID-19 brings a number of both known and unknown risks. I have chosen to attend during the pandemic in the knowledge that there is still a risk of contracting the virus. I understand the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has a long incubation period during which time carriers of the virus may not show symptoms yet still be highly infectious. I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID-19 or possibly infectious.

Please include first and surname. Sarah Arrow Q2. Do you know what the MoreLife programme involves? Yes Q3. What has led to you joining a MoreLife group? GP referral Diagnosis of Diabetes Q4. Why do you want to lose weight at this time? I've always wanted to lose weight. After the birth of my youngest daughter  my hormones went haywire  I developed PCOS and the weight wouldn't shift. I've done VLCD and I cycle daily. And in July I managed to lose 2lbs. Yup  5 miles a day cycling  3 x 20 minute walks  low carb diet  no snacking  no cholocate and for the entire month I've lost 2lbs. I asked the doctor for Ozempic. I have blood pressure through the roof  and I'm mortally obese with diabetes but they won't give it to me as I don't qualify. Q5. What methods have you tried in the past to lose weight? Exercise Meal Replacement i.e. Slimfast Slimming groups i.e. Weight Watchers  Slimming World Reducing Portion Monitoring calories Reducing carbohydrates Q6. Were you successful? No Q7. What was it that prevented it from being a long term solution? Other (please specify): Hormones are up the wall. Which is why I wanted to try Ozempic as I heard it helps balance the insulin etc. And if I had the money I'd buy it Q8. What do you want to get out of the MoreLife programme? e.g. support  dietary guidelines Support Q9. Do you have any health conditions that you wish to make us aware of? Diabestes High blood pressure Mortally obese Currently I have shin splints which means I can't cycle Q10. Do you have Type 2 diabetes? Yes Q11. Do have you have enough support so that you are confident managing your blood sugar levels and medication? N/A Q12. Do you have concerns over your Mental Health? Yes Q13. We work very closely with mental health services within the local area  would you like your practitioner to discuss with you the mental health services that are available to you to gain further support with your mental health? Yes Q14. Please let us know of any other relevant conditions? I don't know about the mental health thing. I have too much to worry about with the diabetes and blood pressure to add mental health to the list. See 15 as well I don't know is also the answer to this. It might be an option I just don't know. I just don't want to die of a stroke or heart attack so I have to consider these options as well Q15. Are you attending the programme in order to be considered for bariatric surgery Yes Q16. If you are taking part in an online Zoom session  do you have a set of scales to weigh yourself at home? Yes Q17. The places on the course are very limited and if you begin the programme and drop out you may not be offered another course. We want you to have the best experience possible. Bearing this in mind is this the right time for you to join a group? Are you able to commit to at least 10 out of the 12 weekly sessions? Yes Q18. I am aware that COVID19 brings a number of both known and unknown risks. I have chosen to attend during the pandemic in the knowledge that there is still a risk of contracting the virus. I understand the coronavirus that causes COVID19 has a long incubation period during which time carriers of the virus may not show symptoms yet still be highly infectious. I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID19 or possibly infectious. I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a preexistent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat Yes Q19. I can confirm that I have not been in close contact of anyone suffering with any of these symptoms in the last 10 days. Yes\n9/7/23 17:46: Completed engagement call. Talked in detail about what we offer and also the possibility of Wegovy (we have none and I can make no promises - but we hope to offer it as soon as we can). Discussed surgery too.\n9/15/23 14:45: recap email sent to all clients: Hello  Please find information below on what was covered during session 1. If you missed the session it’ll help you catch up. If you were there  it’s just a handy recap. We want to firstly welcome you to MoreLife  we look forward to supporting you during this amazing journey. The sessions are designed to give you a greater understanding of how to manage your weight realistically and sustain long term weight loss. Our programme includes 12 weekly sessions which are 1 hour and a half duration along with 8 monthly follow up sessions lasting 1 hour.  We would like to direct you to your handbook to pages 1-19 are relevant to our first session (section 1: getting started) – I would encourage you to take some time to fill out page 8 – ‘why now’  think about/answer questions on pages 9-10 too. It may also be beneficial to make a note of your starting weight/measurements on page 12 and keep a record of your monitoring progress each week. Page 13 is about setting goals – have a think about if you have any long-term goals and make a note of these.  You’ll also set a weekly goal every week. But week 1’s goal is always the same – Keep a food diary! We recommend keeping a food diary throughout the programme to help maintain awareness  you can record a food diary in different ways (we discussed the various methods in our session: apps for example My Fitness Pal which is FREE to download  or My net diary  or (if you want a paid app) Nutracheck  phone notes  pictures  electronic/written diaries etc.) The format is far less important than the accuracy. Pick something you think is doable for you. I’ve attached some bits that may prove useful. If you’d like a food diary template one is attached. But you don’t have to use it. You can keep a food diary in whatever way works for you. I’ve also attached a sheet for you to record your goals week by week. You can use this if you like. Some people prefer to write their goals on their weight recording sheet. Again  whatever works. Lastly  you should have received a log in for an online platform called ‘mylifeplan’. This is our digital platform. I encourage you to log in to this. It’s got several videos and resources on there  and every week that you log in you unlock some new content. If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact with me via e-mail  call and text ?  My best wishes for a great week and I’ll see you all next week!

I’ve got in my diary that I need to send in a photo of my weight on the 29th January  so I went to Boots to get weighed.  When I started Wegovy  on my scales at home   I was 21 st 7. I’m now 20 st 1 - so basically I’ve lost 1.5 stones and when I spoke to someone initially they said I had to lose a stone by this point.  When I went to Boots the first time to get weighed I was 21st 2  so 5 lb lighter than my scales at home.  I went in there today to get weighed and was 20 st 5. So 4 lb more than I was at home. I believe the scales are different since I went last time.  Anyway I’m sure you. A see the impact of that as it looks like I have lost 11 lbs when actually it’s 20 lb.  I wanted to explain this as it will look like I haven’t met the criteria to continue.  I’ve attached a photo of my records- the first number is the date  the second is my weight in stones.  Thank you for reading!  Sally   \n1/30/25 14:53: Please read note below regarding weight for 5 month review\n3/17/25 13:23: IMPORTANT: Your Wegovy 6 month telephone review with our clinician is on 26 March   @ 10.30am.

Best wishes\n11/2/23 14:09: missed session 6 - Hi Darragh   To be honest I’ve had a horrendous week since last Wednesday evening when I found my Mum passed away on her sofa completely unexpectedly. With everything that goes with that and many various friends and family coming round daily plus losing 4 days of not working on my end of month stuff my weight has increased by 5lb which has just added to my stress to be honest.  Yesterday for example I went to my office at 8.30am and got out at 4am this morning which was unavoidable and I’ve had 3hrs sleep feeling pretty stressed and now got calls coming in from the coroner and funeral directors this morning with a few things I need to do for them. I’ll be there at 1pm if I can but right now I think I’ll either be in the middle of sorting stuff out for my mum or asleep  Really Sorry   - - follow up - - -Hi Darragh Sorry I only just saw your reply. I am available if you would like a chat. I think I will be ok from next week but I've no idea at the moment about funeral dates etc.  I really don't want to just stop the sessions now I'm so far into it as I need to do it but being honest I'm just really struggling to apply what we are learning as I'm just so fed up with not being able to train and being in so much pain all the time.  I'm not sure what the answer is right now but I don't think stopping now is the answer.  \n2/22/24 16:23: Dear Doctor   Patient Name: Andre Rayson DOB: 1970-06-05 NHS Number: 4270414995 PLASE NOTE THAT THIS LETTER SHOULD NOT BE USED AS PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY FOR A BARIATRIC REFERRAL PHASE 1 COMPLETED - 12 WEEKLY SESSIONS Thank you for referring the above patient to the MoreLife Tier 3 Weight Management Service.

We have arranged and appointment for session 1 on Friday the 17th at 4.30pm.\n11/19/23 10:11: Had session 1 with Billie on Friday the 17th on November. She mentioned that she had forgotten to work on the book during the week and she had done just a few pages just the day of the session. She therefore had nothing she wanted to talk about. When I started asking her related questions she was not open to talk at all. We finished the session after only half an hour because she wasn't very willing to talk. \n11/26/23 9:45: I had an scheduled appointment with Billie on Friday the 24th Nov. She cancelled the appointment just before it started  she said she couldn't work on the activities in the lessons. I offered her the option of supportiing her with the activities during our session or otherwise pausing the programme until she felt more ready for it  She asked me to go through the activities together so we have rescheduled our appointment for Tuesday the 28th at 6pm.\n11/29/23 8:47: I had session with Billie on Tuesday the 28th at 6pm. She said she was finding hard to complete the activities and follow the sessions. She mentioned she had suffered depression for many years and found it hard to cope.  She had spoken to her GP   who had suggested her to get in contact with MIND. She decided that that was the path she was going to follow and we agreed to pause her programme till further notice. \n1/2/24 12:14: EQ sent re Basildon 10am - 17.1.24 \n1/3/24 9:40: EQ completed - Booked 10am - 17.1.24\n1/9/24 10:09: MLP/Conf email sent - Good Morning Welcome to MoreLife the Weight Management Service.

Dear Dr RE: Michael GIDDINGS DOB: 13.8.1977 NHS: 630 347 5949 Your above-named patient was referred into our specialist weight-management service either by yourself the social prescriber or they made a self-referral. As part of our assessment process we ask all clients to complete a series of psychological questionnaires –D-7/PHQ-9. We have received the following response from your patient that may indicate significant anxiety/depression: Total score from PHQ-9: 22 Answer from question 9 of PHQ-9: Not at all [] Several days [] More than half the days [] Nearly every day [x] Note - above 0 on question 9 of PHQ-9 may indicate a risk of suicidal ideation or self-harm. Total score from GAD-7: 11 In view of this questionnaire score I would be most grateful if you could contact this patient to review their mental health if this hasn’t been reviewed recently. Yours sincerely MoreLife Team\n7/4/23 0:00: PHQ 22 - Q9 nearly every day - GAD 11 = file 3911\n7/12/23 0:00: Email from GP - Dear MoreLife Re: Mr Michael Giddings 13 Aug 1977 8 Highlands Court London Road Leigh-on-Sea Essex SS9 2SL NHS No: 630 347 5949 Tel No: 07462 787873 Thank you for kindly considering expediting this patient’s review with your team. He was referred on 30 May 2023 (copy referral form attached). The requirement for him to lose weight is becoming a serious situation as he is undergoing dialysis and needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible. His weight today is 177 kg and he needs to weight 100 kg or less to be eligible for the transplant. He is slowly losing weight himself however injectable medication would greatly accelerate this and enable a lifesaving transplant when a donor is available. Thank you for your help. Yours sincerely Dr A Salmon Enc: copy MoreLife referral form\n8/16/23 11:23: RFS email to GP - 17.7.23 - attached\n11/6/23 10:17: 2.10 - email rec'd from GP (attached in client's attachments) REPLY - Dear Colleague Thank you for your letter  unfortunately we do not have an open referral for Mr Giddings as he declined our service earlier this year as there were supply issues with saxenda. If you would like us to see your patient  could you please submit an updated referral form. Best wishes\n11/10/23 14:11: GP note on referral - I have been seeing this pleasant 45-year-old gentleman for some months regarding a number of issues  but most notably about his excessive weight and the need for substantial weight loss as rapidly as possible due to his other health conditions.  Mr Giddings is currently being treated for high blood pressure but is also in stage 5 renal failure requiring weekly haemodialysis and a renal transplant as soon as possible. Given Mr Giddings weight of 177kg  this type of surgery is currently ill advised. The renal transplant specialists have informed us that a weight of around 100kg or less would need to be reached in order to make him eligible for a renal transplant and ultimately for it to be successful.  Mr Giddings is working at reducing his weight slowly  but his exercise tolerance is very poor and he is somewhat stuck. I am very grateful that MoreLife has been willing to consider Mr Giddings for treatment with Saxenda  although I understand from Mr Giddings that new patients are not being commenced on this medication due to supply issues.  It is my understanding that Wegovy (Simaglutide) may be more available in the near future though. I would urge you to consider Mr Giddings as a clinically exceptional case as his current situation of renal failure requiring weekly haemodialysis  means that his life expectancy is very low. Without a renal transplant a patient in Mr Giddings situation would not be expected to live beyond 5-10 years. This is a devastating prospect for a 45 year old man  especially knowing that renal transplant would vastly increase this.  Even with Semaglutide treatment and substantial weight loss Mr Gidding's prospects are not great. This treatment would be a lifeline and I cannot emphasise enough how much Mr Giddings wants to grab this chance  have a shot at getting a renal transplant and living to a relatively reasonable age. Your consideration and compassion is greatly appreciated.  Many thanks. Yours faithfully Dr A Salmon  \n3/4/24 11:23: Letter from GP attached re expedition - forwarded to ST/EC\n3/12/24 16:11: Good afternoon  Thank you for sending on the attached letter regarding Mr Giddings.  The clinical team have confirmed that unfortunately chronic renal failure is a contraindication for Semaglutide. Therefore  the team are unable to offer this treatment pathway for this patient. In terms of our weight management 12-month programme  the clinical team have concerns regarding the suitability of this programme as MoreLife provides a general behaviour change dietary advice programme based on healthy eating  and whether more of a specialist renal clinic and referral to a renal dietician is required for this patient. The team will be meeting on the 4th April to discuss Mr Giddings case  and we will let you know of the outcomes and the recommended treatment after this meeting.  Please feel free to get in touch if you have any further questions.

He has dialysis at Southend Hospital under Dr Prakash. His GP is Dr Salmon He was initially reluctant to consider bariatric surgery but on the understanding that he is unlikely to reach the 100kg weight loss as stipulated by the renal transplant team he wishes to be referred.  Action 1.\tCould you please ask the GP to refer for bariatric surgery We have discussed Wygovy and he still wants to be considered for the treatment. He understands the limitations of MoreLife and difficult we would have managing him solely through MoreLife. He wishes to attend a weight management programme and have access to the wider MDT team.  Action  2.\tI would be grateful if he could be offered a place on the weight management programme when available. I would also recommend that the GP refers him to me at Southend Hospital so that I can have the required joint care with the renal physicians and access to any blood tests  imaging and relevant changes in clinical status. Action 3.\tCan you please ask the GP to refer to Dr Herring  Consultant Endocrinologist at Southend Hospital He can also be supported by me through MoreLife and I will need to provide prescriptions through MoreLife as this is the chosen prescribing avenue set by the MSE ICB and I will not be able to prescribe from Southend Hospital.

Kind Regards  Dr Roselle Herring Consultant Endocrinologist and Diabetologist MoreLife (Ltd) UK \n5/24/24 10:09: Email sent to South Essex commissioner:  Hi Sarah    I hope you’re well.   We have recently received an urgent letter from a GP to request an assessment for their patient who is currently on our waiting list as a clinical exception  please find the background and recommendations from our clinical team for this patient below.    Age: 45 BMI: 62.7 Health Conditions:  Stage 5 renal failure requiring haemodialysis 3 times a week since June 2021. Unfit for transplant due to obesity. Weight loss target set. Essential hypertension Left brachiocephalic AVF Left ventricular failure Medication: Amilodipine Ramipril Haemodialysis at Southend Hospital Reason for clinical exception and individual funding request: Morbid obesity with multiple comorbidities. Unfit for renal transplant due to obesity. High cardiovascular risk due to ESRD and left ventricular failure with a cardiovascular event likely to cause significant dependency. Patient life expectancy is currently 2- 5 years without renal transplantation and medical intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk. In order to increase life expectancy and quality of life and reduce current comorbidities a renal transplant is necessary. The renal transplant specialists have assessed and recommended that a weight of around 100kg or less would need to be reached in order to make the patient eligible for a renal transplant and reduce the risk of intraoperative and post operative complications.   Our clinical team and Consultant endocrinologist have since provided this patient with an assessment and have confirmed that this patient is at very high mortality and morbidity risk and have recommended that this patient should be seen as a clinical exception for Tier 3 weight management. They believe the patient’s situation is exceptional. The benefits of weight management would produce not only a reduction in this patient’s comorbidities with related health benefits but they would gain more clinical benefit with regards to their renal treatment options and quality of life. The clinical’s team recommendation is that this patient should be prioritised and fast tracked on to the weight management programme with assessment for Wegovy to support weight loss. If 10-15% weight loss could be achieved it opens the potential for additional weight loss intervention and ultimately renal transplantation.   Due to the exceptional high risk of the patient and unique patient status. This patient has also been referred by their GP for specialist Endocrinology to enable face to face assessment and support at Southend Hospital. This would also ensure safe patient management and a multidisciplinary approach with their specialist renal Consultant if a weight management programme and obesity medication were to be initiated.  I just wanted to run this by you  based on the recommendations of our clinical team above and the client’s GP  can we start this client’s weight management journey asap and assess them for Wegovy? If you are agree for us to go ahead with this client’s treatment  are you happy for us to include this client in the 198 Wegovy funded places for 2024/2025 if eligible? I know the 198 Wegovy funded places hasn’t yet been signed off in our newest contract.

I am aware that COVID19 brings a number of both known and unknown risks. I have chosen to attend during the pandemic in the knowledge that there is still a risk of contracting the virus. I understand the coronavirus that causes COVID19 has a long incubation period during which time carriers of the virus may not show symptoms yet still be highly infectious. I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID19 or possibly infectious. I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a preexistent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat Yes Q19.

Then I sent a text showing the location of the Church ready for their first session.\n9/15/23 14:45: recap email sent to all clients: Hello  Please find information below on what was covered during session 1. If you missed the session it’ll help you catch up. If you were there  it’s just a handy recap. We want to firstly welcome you to MoreLife  we look forward to supporting you during this amazing journey. The sessions are designed to give you a greater understanding of how to manage your weight realistically and sustain long term weight loss. Our programme includes 12 weekly sessions which are 1 hour and a half duration along with 8 monthly follow up sessions lasting 1 hour.  We would like to direct you to your handbook to pages 1-19 are relevant to our first session (section 1: getting started) – I would encourage you to take some time to fill out page 8 – ‘why now’  think about/answer questions on pages 9-10 too. It may also be beneficial to make a note of your starting weight/measurements on page 12 and keep a record of your monitoring progress each week. Page 13 is about setting goals – have a think about if you have any long-term goals and make a note of these.  You’ll also set a weekly goal every week. But week 1’s goal is always the same – Keep a food diary! We recommend keeping a food diary throughout the programme to help maintain awareness  you can record a food diary in different ways (we discussed the various methods in our session: apps for example My Fitness Pal which is FREE to download  or My net diary  or (if you want a paid app) Nutracheck  phone notes  pictures  electronic/written diaries etc.) The format is far less important than the accuracy. Pick something you think is doable for you. I’ve attached some bits that may prove useful. If you’d like a food diary template one is attached. But you don’t have to use it. You can keep a food diary in whatever way works for you. I’ve also attached a sheet for you to record your goals week by week. You can use this if you like. Some people prefer to write their goals on their weight recording sheet. Again  whatever works. Lastly  you should have received a log in for an online platform called ‘mylifeplan’. This is our digital platform. I encourage you to log in to this. It’s got several videos and resources on there  and every week that you log in you unlock some new content. If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact with me via e-mail  call and text ?  My best wishes for a great week and I’ll see you all next week!

We are writing to inform you that Shuria has been removed from our programme/ waiting list for the following reason:- o During the initial triage assessment a questionnaire is sent to the patient which was not completed this time.

As I’m sure you know  you’re booked on to a MoreLife weight loss group starting on Monday 11th September (on Monday). I’m your practitioner and so I’ll be running that group for you. I just thought I’d email you all to introduce myself. Also  to give you some details on your group so that you know where you’re going. Here’s the group details: Date: Monday 11th September (and every Monday after up to 12 sessions) Time: 10am-11:30am Location: Socketts Heath Baptist Church  Premier Ave  Grays  RM16 2SB Here’s a google maps link: https://goo.gl/maps/pHkGZxyKSwPX1ZEH7 There is a small car park  but if it gets full there’s also on street parking around the area of the church. I’ll be calling everyone on the group either before  or soon after the first session  so I’ll be speaking to you all soon anyway  but if you need anything you can always call me on my number below. I look forward to meeting you all on Monday! Sarah Thorpe Delivery Lead – Essex Tel: 07990 044966 MoreLife (UK) Ltd \n9/11/23 14:18: 08/09/23 - Engagement call. Called this client on the evening of 8th September. They answered. We went through their engagement questionnaire and I answered some questions about the programme. Then I sent a text showing the location of the Church ready for their first session.\n9/15/23 14:45: recap email sent to all clients: Hello  Please find information below on what was covered during session 1. If you missed the session it’ll help you catch up. If you were there  it’s just a handy recap. We want to firstly welcome you to MoreLife  we look forward to supporting you during this amazing journey. The sessions are designed to give you a greater understanding of how to manage your weight realistically and sustain long term weight loss. Our programme includes 12 weekly sessions which are 1 hour and a half duration along with 8 monthly follow up sessions lasting 1 hour.  We would like to direct you to your handbook to pages 1-19 are relevant to our first session (section 1: getting started) – I would encourage you to take some time to fill out page 8 – ‘why now’  think about/answer questions on pages 9-10 too. It may also be beneficial to make a note of your starting weight/measurements on page 12 and keep a record of your monitoring progress each week. Page 13 is about setting goals – have a think about if you have any long-term goals and make a note of these.  You’ll also set a weekly goal every week. But week 1’s goal is always the same – Keep a food diary! We recommend keeping a food diary throughout the programme to help maintain awareness  you can record a food diary in different ways (we discussed the various methods in our session: apps for example My Fitness Pal which is FREE to download  or My net diary  or (if you want a paid app) Nutracheck  phone notes  pictures  electronic/written diaries etc.) The format is far less important than the accuracy. Pick something you think is doable for you. I’ve attached some bits that may prove useful. If you’d like a food diary template one is attached. But you don’t have to use it. You can keep a food diary in whatever way works for you. I’ve also attached a sheet for you to record your goals week by week. You can use this if you like. Some people prefer to write their goals on their weight recording sheet. Again  whatever works. Lastly  you should have received a log in for an online platform called ‘mylifeplan’. This is our digital platform. I encourage you to log in to this. It’s got several videos and resources on there  and every week that you log in you unlock some new content. If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact with me via e-mail  call and text ?  My best wishes for a great week and I’ll see you all next week!

I was referred to a tier 3 management service by my GP  I think this was Nov last year. Although it has been so long I cannot remember the exact referral date. I provided all my forms and details and was told there would be a place available in April. I still have not heard anything about placement on a programme since telling an adviser my preferred method of attendance. I have attempted to contact via telephone  but had no luck speaking with someone.  Is there any possibility of some information to when a placement will be available? Or any updates on next steps.  Thank you.  Bradley Davis  REPLY - Hi Bradley Thank you for your email. We have been experiencing very high volumes of referrals and unfortunately have waiting lists longer than we would like. We are working with our commissioners to address this situation and will be in touch just as soon as we are able to offer you a Basildon programme at 6pm.

Please note that due to National stock shortage of Saxenda  we are unable to continue screening the clients for eligibility for Saxenda based on criteria specified by NICE. Since there is no certainty about Saxenda's  long-term availability and as per information from Department of Health &Social Care dated July 2023  no new initiations can be made for clients on Saxenda pathway. I shall update you  if there is any further information available on this.

Please do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. Good afternoon Ranjana   I’m hope you don’t mind the direct email. I’m hoping to get some information regarding this email chain. I now have been prescribed ramipril medication to control my BP and my BMI has not changed since the last time we spoke via email?  Would I now qualify for Sanxenda? I understand the strict qualifying criteria  but feel something like this would really support me to live a better and more successful lifestyle. I have also been waiting for their 3 weight management support since December 2022.  If you could advise me farther on this  that would be great.  Thanks   Bradley Davis. \n1/8/24 16:35: vm/text re 6pm - 23.1.24\n1/9/24 16:29: EQ sent - re 6pm Basildon 23.1.24\n1/12/24 9:23: EQ completed - booked Basildon 6pm - 23.1.24\n1/17/24 10:47: MLP/Conf email sent - Good Morning Welcome to MoreLife the Weight Management Service.

Best Wishes \n3/18/24 15:42: PCS REQUESTED\n4/24/24 14:26: Call from Bradley -  has emailed the wegovy email address and was concerned that he hadn’t heard from anyone. I explained that CB has been on annual leave. He's concern is that he has finished the 12 week part of the programme – others on that group have already started wegovy and he wonders if/when he will. I told him that CB had requested information from his GP back in March. \n4/25/24 9:19: Good morning I am still awaiting PCS from your GP Once we have this we will screen eligibility and place you on our waiting list Kind regards Claire\n5/10/24 9:37: 12 week letter could not be sent through MCG so I sent it through my NHS account: Dear Doctor   Patient Name:  Bradley Davis\t  DOB: 1994-08-01 \tNHS Number: 4265306128 PLASE NOTE THAT THIS LETTER SHOULD NOT BE USED AS PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY FOR A BARIATRIC REFERRAL PHASE 1 COMPLETED - 12 WEEKLY SESSIONS Thank you for referring the above patient to the MoreLife Tier 3 Weight Management Service. Bradley has now completed phase 1 of the course and we give below their weight at session 1 and session 12: Session 1:\t23/01/2024 - 112.8 kg Session 12: \t16/04/2024 - 114.6 kg Bradley attended 12 of the 12 sessions.

Yours Sincerely MoreLife Team\n6/24/24 12:12: pcs requested\n7/1/24 11:18: eligible for wegovy BP medicated\n8/14/24 10:18: Hi Claire   I hope this email finds you well.  I spoke with my MoreLife Group Lead a few session back about the progress of the eligibility for the medication. Matt mentioned that funding wasn’t available for the WeGovy medication currently but once it was re award screening will continue.  Would it be possible to have an update on my eligibility  I attached the requested documents but didn’t hear anything back. As a side note  I have had my blood pressure medication increase as previous therapies and  treatments for high blood pressure was ineffective.  Any update would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you  Bradley Davis. Morning Bradley You are on the waiting list  It will be a few months yet before your assessment. I will be in touch once I have a date for you Claire \n10/30/24 9:02: Hi Claire   I hope you are well. I have been asked by my course co-ordinator to drop an email to follow up.  I do apologise for another email regarding this. It is not my intention to pester and I do feel terrible asking yet again; as I’m only on the more life service for 1 more session  I am worried that I will not be able to access if I am eligible for this medication. I spoke with my GP last week  who is very concerned regarding my weight and the impact it is having on my blood pressure.  Will I still be eligible for this after leaving the service or will my waiting list position no longer be available? Apologies yet again for the email. I really do appreciate the responses.  Thank you   Bradley Davis. Attendance is showing missed last 4 have enailed Orla to check \n11/6/24 15:38: Good morning Bradley  Our system is showing you haven't attended the last 4 sessions with us. Kind regards Claire \n11/6/24 15:38: Hi Claire   Thanks for the clarification.  Sessions were missed because they couldn’t be held or rescheduled; I was away during the August/September session. The other sessions were cancelled due to a combination of the venue needing the space and Matt being unwell with back issues. I explained to Matt that  due to my work schedule  I have to book these sessions off as leave and am required to give advance notice to amend any approved leave. Additionally  changes to sessions have sometimes been communicated with only a day’s notice (in one instance  a session was cancelled with just a few hours’ notice). I understand that MoreLife is experiencing staffing issues following recent departures  as Matt has mentioned numerous times. However  the inconsistency and very last-minute changes to session times and dates make it challenging to commit. Thanks for your understanding.  Bradley Davis. \n11/6/24 15:39: Morning Matt    Thank you for below email.   Can you confirm please (not sure if you or other Matt) I will then be able to book him in if this is correct.   Have a good day   Claire ? Hi Claire   This does sound correct. I took this group around 2/3 months into their maintenance  and I believe there had been issues with the sessions changing due to staff leaving MoreLife and finding cover.  Best wishes  Matthew Buckley \n11/19/24 12:29: Hi Claire   I am sympathetic to him because it has been very disrupted  and I know some groups had a lot of different practitioners delivering. Can we still send over some catch up emails and ask him to confirm he has caught up on the content and is happy he has enough knowledge of the behaviour change side of the intervention to support his medication journey? Thanks  Grace  \n11/21/24 13:14: Wegovy confirmation letter  PES and leaflet sent\n11/25/24 12:11: Wegovy Assessment done BMI 41 and hypertension Please see attached proforma Advised monthly home BP checks and to do if feels dizzy/faint See GP if BP less than120/80 or symptomatic Await validated weight\n11/26/24 9:34: Hi Claire  Thank you for your email. I am so pleased that I have met the criteria. I have booked all the sessions noted off work and will be able to attend.  Apologies for missing your previous email. Yes  I emailed the delivery lead earlier this week regarding catching up on the few missed sessions. I can also provide two months’ worth of weigh-ins  which were completed at my GP during my medication reviews. I hope to hear back from the course lead soon  I emailed early in the week for him to drop me a call but haven’t had a response yet  but it’s no stress.  Thanks again for all your help  and patience with my badgering!  Bradley Davis.\n12/13/24 14:16: IMPORTANT: Appointment Reminder for Wegovy Dietetic assessment telephone appointment 16/12/24 @9:45am. For support email: wegovy@more-life.co.uk\n12/16/24 11:25: Hi Claire   Is there a possibility to reschedule this appointment. Unfortunately  after my first dose of the Wegovy medication I was left with a 3 day migraine followed then by catching the flu. I also confused this session with the nutritionist appointment and waited for a telephone call (My plan to explain to the nurse about my migraine and ask to reschedule). Looking back on the appointments I now realised this was a teams meetings. Please let me know if this is possible.  Also how does the prescription work? I’m nearing my 3rd week injection. Will it just automatically be sent out or do I have to request this?  Thanks for your help Bradley Davis. \n12/16/24 14:25: Client attended wegovy week-3 dietetic assessment - notes uploaded  clinical team notified.\n12/17/24 11:51: 0.5 mg wegovy issued\n1/3/25 13:14: From: Ranjana Babber  Sent: 03 January 2025 13:13 To: Orla McMahon <orla.mcmahon@more-life.co.uk> Cc: Nikola Smith <nikola.smith@more-life.co.uk>; Claire Benson <claire.benson@more-life.co.uk> Subject: 0064213 - BD (Essex) Wegvy pathway Hi Orla  This client had missed 6 monthly maintenance sessions- though it seems due to staffing issues on our side (MorelIfe)-some sessions were cancelled or rescheduled at very short notice. Can this client be approached and offered couple of monthly session to make up for attendance as required on Wegovy pathway. Also  If client has MLP access. Thanking You Regards Dr Ranjana Babber Dietetic Lead \n1/3/25 14:52: Hello Bradley   I hope you’re well and happy new year to you.  Our clinical team have screened you and you are eligible for our Wegovy pathway. however  to be a part of the pathway it is required to complete at least 6 out of 8 maintenance sessions.  So far you have only completed 2 sessions out of the 8 that were run for your group. However  we understand there was a lot of disruption to your sessions changing practitioner and changing dates so we’d like to apologise and offer you another group to catch up with in order to complete the required sessions.  Please see the available groups for you to join below. Please note these are online groups facilitated over Microsoft Teams  you will need to attend the next 4 sessions over the next 4 months to remain on the Wegovy pathway: - Tues 6pm - Wednesday 5pm - Thurs 11:30am  - Thurs 6pm  - Thurs 7pm - Friday 10am Please respond letting me know which slot works best for you. the sessions will be once per month as before. Once confirmed I will move you to the group and let you know the next date. Your new practitioner will be in touch with the link before the session.  Please let me know if you have any questions. Hope you have a lovely weekend! Thanks   Orla McMahon  MSc  ANutr \n1/6/25 9:36: Response from client:  Hi Orla   Thank you so much for getting in touch. I didn’t want all the disruption to the maintenance session to effect my Wegovy pathway; this is my second prescription and it’s working great. I will not take the opportunity to catch up for granted. I really appreciate the opportunity.  Following that  would I be able to go for the Tuesday 6pm session. Can I confirm these session will be on teams rather than in person?  Additionally  would you be able to pass over the dates for the 4 session so I can ensure they are booked in as holiday.  Thank again for reaching out. Best wishes for 2025!  Bradley Davis. My response: Hello Bradley   Thank you for your quick response. I’m glad to hear you’re finding the medication so helpful. We can absolutely add you to the Tues 6pm group and yes that’s correct that it will be online over Microsoft teams. If you are planning on using a phone or tablet to access the meeting you will need to download the Microsoft Teams app. If using a computer or laptop  you don’t need it.  It will be the 3rd Tuesday of each month. The next two dates are: -\t21st January -\t18th February -\t18th March We don’t have April’s scheduled in yet but as it’s the third Tuesday I’d imagine it’ll be the 15th April ? I have added you to the group  your practitioner will be Maria Urquijo and she will send the link out and a reminder on the day of the session.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

In the meantime there are a number of other services that are freely available for you to join in your area. Rest assured you will still be able to join MoreLife’s Tier 3 Weight Management programme even if you decide to join another programme whilst waiting for a place to become available.

Please advise regarding their position on the waiting list and approximate to frame to start the programme:   Mrs Sarah Sharna Wahid  DOB: 16 Nov 1974   Kindest regards   REPLY - Thank you for your email. We have received the referral and she is on the waiting list for a group. Unfortunately our waiting lists are longer than we would like  and so currently people referred in June can expect to wait many months for a place on a programme.   We recognise that this isn’t ideal  as do our commissioners at the ICB and we have been working with them to shorten waiting times. I’ve attached a letter that was sent out to the patient in February  which should explain the situation more clearly. We are currently awaiting a decision from the ICB on their course of action  which could drastically alter our waiting times. So  at the present time it is very difficult to give an estimation of expected waiting times  as these are largely dependent on the upcoming decisions of the ICB.   I’m sorry that I cannot give a clear time-frame  but it is hoped that more information will be available soon.

You will have to attend 6 sessions with MoreLife before we prescribe  there is a waiting list in place. Kind regards Claire Hello More life  Team I’m sending you this message just to check on the progress of my Wagovy application My name is Sarah Wahid and today I received a call from my GP Surgery manager informing me that all the information you requested has been given and that I should give you a call for an update. Can someone please call me 07522153357 / sarahshana1j@yahoo.co.uk Thank you  Sarah Wahid. \n8/15/24 11:20: Hi Claire Thank you for letting me know I must admit and let you know how this news for me is devastating and makes my anxiety sore through the roof  I understand that there are other patients for you to get to but I have patiently waited over a year for this program and i cannot stress just how important this is for me I don't know if my GP made you aware but I'm going to make sure you know that this isn't just a weight loss journey for me it's also about my Spinal cord injury you see I'm currently on the pathway for a surgery that may change my whole life and the quality of life that I'm currently living or lack thereof. It's paramount that I lose some weight as soon as humanly possible for the surgeon to go ahead with the Spinal Cord Simulator Surgery I must bring my BMI down to 36 in order for the surgery to be safe and successful  this surgery will have a profound effect on my life and could eliminate up to 75% of the Chronic pain that I have had to live with since the assault in 2019  I am not asking for special treatment i Just want to have a better quality of life and part of the reason that my weight has increased is because of the medication Pregabilin I have had to take everyday for the severe nerve damage that has taken over the entire left side of my body sustained by my neck being broken in three places affecting the vertebrae's that control the hands  arms and legs  it affects my mobility and balance also. I really need this Wegovy Claire and I beg that you try to find a way to make an exception to get it for me so that I can have this Simulator surgery as soon as possible  please. Iv'e been working really hard to get my weight down less carbs and lots of protein this is why my weight has stabilized at 116 Kg and fluxsuates between 116 and 120 kg which is so frustrating when I'm putting the hard work to get it down and I actually thought that I had already been assessed for the Wegovy last year and told that I was a suitable candidate for it. Please again I beg and pray that you see if there is something you can do to hurry this process along and help me because this surgery is literally on hold until I bring my BMI down  I live and pray for the day where I no longer have to take this life altering medication anymore and can embark on a better quality of life. kindest regards Sarah Wahid.\n8/21/24 9:14: Hi Sarah Assessments/Prescriptions will start mid September through to March 2025. There are patients on the waiting list that started their groups in January but I have forwarded your email for further advise. Kind regards Claire \n8/29/24 11:50: Hello and Good morning Claire I have just finished session four of the More Life Program and I must say I am enjoying it because the group interacts via open group sessions so I get to meet everyone in my group who are going through some of the same issues as me and interact with them that helps me to feel and know that I am not alone and helps with my lack of socializing and anxiety  also Matthew our coach is really nice and approachable which is great because he makes us all feel comfortable in the sense that we can go to him with questions and concerns and he has a natural and calm way about him and is knowledgeable and very informative so we're learning a lot. Thank you again for all your help and your effort to understand my situation  in reference to your last email I want to ask you to clarify the next step for me receiving the weight lost medication  you mentioned that you had forwarded my email l to someone so am I now just waiting for them to contact me ??? I have an appointment coming up next week with my Pain Management Consultant and I'd like to be able to let him know been as I'm already on the pathway for my Spinal Cord Simulator Surgery. kindest regards Sarah Wahid.\n8/29/24 11:51: Hello Sarah  I'm so glad you're enjoying your sessions. I've just had an email back. Your case is being discussed at our MDT 12th September. Would it be possible to forward any information regarding your upcoming surgery from your Spinal team?  Many thanks Claire Hi Claire  I reviewed this client's details on MCG and they have already attended 3-4 sessions for AWM. Do you know how far are they on screening list for Wegovy. I think we should discuss about this case (0065948) in MDT as their medical notes state autonomic dysreflexia and if that could be rationale for  expediating  for Wegovy? I cannot see any notes from medical/ surgeon - for they must reach BMI36 prior to spinal cord surgery as mentioned by client- but can check with DR summer's if that is a criteria? Thanking You Regards Ranjana Babber\n8/30/24 8:37: added to MDT regarding access to wegovy\n9/2/24 11:06: spinal letter uploaded\n9/2/24 11:07: Please find attached as requested letter to GP from Chronic Pain Specialist Regarding my intended urgently needed surgery.

In order to check your eligibility  we need an up-to-date medical history and relevant blood results (please see further details below) dated within the last 12 months.   *In particular we need: •\tUp to date medication list •\tUp to date medical history (including surgical) •\teGFR •\tLipid profile •\tBlood pressure •\tHbA1c If you have not had the above tests in the last 12 months  please could you arrange these blood tests with your GP and please send us the results when available to claire.benson4@nhs.net If you have access to the NHS app then you should have access to this information directly  please send us your results to the following email address claire.benson4@nhs.net Unfortunately  without this information we are unable to assess your eligibility for Wegovy. Please do send this information across as soon as possible to the following email address claire.benson4@nhs.net Please note that our team will be working as quickly as possible to screen you for Wegovy  however please be aware that the outcome of the screening may take some weeks after you have initially started your weight management programme. We thank you for your patience in advance. If you are eligible for Wegovy  we will firstly need to ensure you are committed to our weight management programme and therefore appointments will only be issued after 6 weeks of attendance. Your attendance throughout the weight management programme is essential to the start and your continuation of the Wegovy treatment.  You will be notified by the team via email on your eligibility for Wegovy.

I had loads of blood tests and blood pressures done at the end of June as I was in hospital  but I was never given the results of any of them?  Please tell me how I am to retrieve the information you need? I was referred through my GP so can you not get that information from them? I really want to do the program so please advise me what to do as I start on the 9th September. Kind regards  Rebecca Brenchley --- REPLY ---Hello Rebecca Your place on the programme is fully confirmed. Please do not worry about this. With regards to the information requested for accessing Wegovy  we can request from your GP but we have found that if you have access to your medical records via the NHS App then this can be quicker.

I had a bit of trouble this week  my pen wouldn't work and is being sent back once I've received the return package but the problem is  I didn't obviously get my dose this week and possibly didn't get it last week as this pen is faulty. Could you issue me a replacement asap and advise me what to do in terms of when to inject again having not had it in my system for possibly 1-2 weeks. I'm quite frustrated at this having injected myself for nothing and setting me back on my results which is incredibly upsetting. Please contact me on 07710557994 if that is more convenient. Kind regards  Rebecca  Fwd'd to RB/ZA\n3/17/25 21:00: 1mg issued ",

I was wondering if you found out about any gp referrals for the Basildon area? I know we talked about it yesterday.  I also wanted to let you know I made a very big change to a normal habit today. We walk along the seafront in leigh or chalkwall quite regularly. We always stop and have a Rossi mr whippy and then walk back.  Today we parked slightly further away and walked slightly further than normal but the main achievement was that I refused a Mr Whippy!! Totally unheard of for me. My husband was shell shocked lol.  We walked 4 miles and for me that’s a long walk.  Your course is really helping keep me focused.  Thank you Joanne.  \n2/9/24 13:27: missed session 5 - Hi Darragh  I am not sure I can make tonight.

Hi Claire  I have completed 5 month Wegovy review with this client. She has taken two weekly doses of 1.7mg of Wegovy and due next dose tomorrow. She stated being sick last week  8/08/2024 day after taking 1.7mg (second weekly dose)- one episode of vomiting.  She had been to her GP and they have adjusted dose for their blood pressure medication. And also prescribed lansoprazole 30mg OD- which she is now taking regularly. She is also prescribed anti sickness tablet ( not sure of name- may be metaclopramide up to 3 times a day) which she has not started- as it feels it will affect the functioning/ efficacy of wegovy. I had explained her that she can take anti sickness tablet as advised by their GP. Client has blood test due on Friday (she said that GP has not received letter sent twice by you- but happy to do repeat test for LFT  KFT  hbA1c  and cholesterol) and she will update us on results. She stated she is feeling discomfort due to feeling of sickness  bad breath and scared to take higher dose of 2.4mg and would even think if she could be moved back to 1mg weekly dose. She has been constipated for few days (3 days) and followed by diarrhea. Took history for bowel movements and she said prior to starting wegovy she used to go 4 times in a day. Discussed dietary measures to manage constipation. the volume of food is gone down  although she is managing 3 small meals and choosing whole meal options and drinking water. discussed to increase bulk by having vegetables for snack or portion of nuts & seeds. Also to seek advice with pharmacist/ GP for laxative if constipation is not resolved with dietary measures. I shall give her a quick call on Friday for follow up. Since she has two more doses for 1.7mg left with her- I explained it is best to wait test results  for Claire M to review the plan for next dose of Wegovy. Client reported weight loss of 2stones in 4 months. Claire Mckee action- to review  above summary of 5th month review and blood test results for further prescription plan next week starting 19th August . Thanking You Regards Ranjana Babber\n8/16/24 9:57: RB called client for Wegovy follow up. Client said she is not comfortable moving to 2.4mg. She said she has taken third weekly dose of 1.7mg on wednesday 14/08/2024 and due last dose of 1.7 mg on 21/08/2024. She has not started antisickness tablet advised by GP. She feels she is better than last week (no episode of vomit) but still diziness/  weakness while standing. I have asked her to contact GP/ A&E if feeling worst. Could you please speak to her on 21/08/2024 and advice further. (she said she has appointment with you on 21st and you will call her from Caravan- but I donot see anything on appointment planner). she confirmed she is able to drink water adequately and no diarrhea.\n8/20/24 13:19: WEGOVY - Email Update from client as below  email is forwarded to Claire M for their update and for further Wegovy prescription. Good morning Ranjana  I hope you are well. I spoke to the dr regarding my blood tests today and she was happy with most of them. I am no longer pre diabetic as my levels have dropped from 44 to 34. The only thing that she flagged up was my ALT levels were slightly raised to 53  but this could be because I have a fatty liver and I have also got liver cysts. To be proactive the dr has referred me for an ultra sound. She is very pleased with my weight loss so far. I had virtually zero side effects from the injection last Wednesday and actually feel the best I have in the last 4 weeks  so that is great news for me. I am now managing my water and am now eating most of my calories every day with almost no nausea. No sulphur burps or vomiting either.  I still think it would be best to stay on 1.7 for another month if that’s possible.

She thinks it’s likely to have been viral as it has settled down now.

Do not click links/open attachments unless you recognise the sender.  Hi It looks like the patient saw a clinical practitioner last night. Importantly  their abdomen was soft and they had bowel sounds when examined. I think she should withhold her any further Wegovy injections until her symptoms have completely resolved and she has fully resumed normal eating with return of normal bowel habit. If symptoms completely settle over the next week  then I would recommend that she restarts the beginning of December on 1mg and it can be titrated as required thereafter.

We have had a huge amount of demand for the service in the past year and so unfortunately we currently have a longer waiting list than usual. The good news is that more places will become available from April 2023. MoreLife will keep you on the waiting list and you will be one of the first to be offered a place when more are confirmed by South Essex ICB. In the meantime there are a number of other services that are freely available for you to join in your area.

Matt Buckley did it previously but it could do with being updated. I’ve tried to look at calculators on line and the Morelife one but don’t get the same calorie breakdown. I’d like maintenance  TDEE and a range to stay within if that’s possible. Any ideas? Thanks  Clare  forwarded to Keisha\n3/5/25 16:41: Email sent back to client regarding updated EER / Kcal targets: Hello  Please see below for the calorie targets we would recommend. Please let me know how you get on if you would like any more support with this.    •\tYour energy requirements to maintain your current weight would be: 2579 kcals    •\tTo achieve a 1lb (0.5 kg) per week weight loss  you would need to reduce your energy intake by 600 kcal per day. The energy requirements to reach this target would be: 1979 kcals    •\tTo achieve a 2lb (1 kg) per week weight loss  the energy requirement would be: 1379 kcals *We do not recommend that you go below 1200kcal/day.    Why do MoreLife not recommended that I go below 1200 calories per day?  MoreLife does not recommend eating less than 1 200 calories per day for multiple reasons. As covered in our first nutrition session  our bodies - made up of muscles  bones  and organs (such as our heart and brain) - need energy and nutrients from the food we eat in order to keep us alive and feeling good.  The same way that a car needs fuel to keep it running smoothly  our bodies need calories to keep all its functions working correctly. If you do not give your body enough calories (fuel) you might experience low energy  dizziness  difficulty concentrating  headaches and extreme hunger.  Eating too few calories for a prolonged period can lead to malnutrition and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.  Finally  when losing weight  we want to make sure we are doing it as sustainably as possible. Restricting calories too much will cause hunger  making it harder to sustain for a long time  taking us back to the start of our journey.  Is it okay if I choose a calorie goal between the 1-2lb weight loss target?  Whether you decide to choose the goal of 1 lb per week weight loss or 2 lb is personal to you. You can also pick a target between the two values. Think about which goal is most realistic for you and therefore more sustainable.  Reducing calories too much may be difficult if your hunger levels increase. Therefore  it may be best that you first reduce your calories to the 1 lb weight loss target whilst you get used to reducing your calories  and once you feel comfortable and you have adjusted to your new calorie goal  you can reduce your calories further to the 2 lb target.   The only time we wouldn’t recommend aiming for a weight loss of 2 lb per week is if the calorie requirements to do this drop below our minimum daily calorie recommendation of 1200 calories.   For example  if your daily calorie target to lose 2 lb per week is 1000  we would recommend that you still go for our minimum recommendation of 1200.  Please find below an example video for 3 different calorie tracking apps that we’ve found to be the most useful for our clients on the programme. We’ve given you 3 to choose from  as you may find one is easier to use for yourself. •\tMyFitnessPal - https://youtu.be/DKvMYuCOsEI?si=gZsmOVFNr7VcnwHN  •\tLose It - https://youtu.be/fKYgpivRlGM?si=UxqzrREWK9iIqDka •\tNutracheck - https://youtu.be/yse5QVgOrrI?si=_yKaddjDV43-BjYm Please note: Some videos will discussed tracking macros. To keep it simple  please focus on your overall caloric intake. Who do I need to contact if I have any nutrition-based questions?  Providing your question can be answer within the scope of this service  if you have any nutrition questions during your first 12-weeks  these should be sent to your Adult Weight Management Practitioner. In the monthly phase  please ask your Nutrition Support Practitioner.

I'm now not sure if this is where you have dye put in your eye procedure or if this can be digital photos of the vessels amd back of your eye..... I'm confused because she mentioned specsavers do it and will be much quicker than waiting for doctors referral but when I have spoken to specsavers they don't do the full screening with dye in eye  only the photo ones they do for every over 40s adult test.  There will obviously be a big difference in waiting time.  If possible could you confirm thanks emma  forwarded ro RH\n5/7/24 9:05: Hi Claire  Hi  it's taken me 5 days to get the retinal scan results from specsavers  it's been ridiculous. Good news he said my scans are fine and healthy.....  So now I've had the go ahead from the doctor and I attended the zoom meeting on the 24th and I've now got these scan pics I'm hoping I'm good to go....  Hopefully I manage to attach them to the email this time too. If you could let me know what happens next that would be great I've had so many issues and it's taken so long I'm hoping everything is OK now.

Also me and the doctor had noticed my appointments were a bit all over the place and was thinking it might be because of the delay in me starting...... she cancelled one (31st july) because I had 2 booked for the same month. And also it means that the list/your records say I'm now at month 5 but I'm not I'm at month 4.

I am aware that COVID-19 brings a number of both known and unknown risks. I have chosen to attend during the pandemic in the knowledge that there is still a risk of contracting the virus. I understand the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has a long incubation period during which time carriers of the virus may not show symptoms yet still be highly infectious. I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID-19 or possibly infectious. I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID-19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a pre-existent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat No Q19. I can confirm that I have not been in close contact of anyone suffering with any of these symptoms in the last 10 days.

We have had a huge amount of demand for the service in the past year and so unfortunately we currently have a longer waiting list than usual.

My circumstances have changed so I will be able to accommodate them. Can I check how long the sessions are? Best wishes Shel REPLY - Hi Sherry Thank you for your email. I have put you on the waiting list for a 10am programme – each session lasts an hour and a half. Best wishes\n9/4/23 15:32: Email from Sherry - Hi Liz  Hope you are well  I'm just checking in to see where I am on the waiting list for the zoom sessions. I've been waiting for a place since November and was wondering how much longer this would take? Also  I understand wegovy has now been approved for UK use and wondered if this would be offered under the programme or if this could now be accessed by GPS? Any information you have around this would be amazing.  Best wishes  Shel REPLY - Hi Shel I am really sorry for the length of time you have been waiting  unfortunately I do not have any idea of when we will be able to offer you a place on a programme. Best wishes \n9/6/23 16:12: Email from Client - Hi Liz  Thanks for coming back so quickly. In April I was advised that more places would become available.  Is it that the programme is full to capacity currently? And there is no end date for those currently on the programme?  Is that why you are unable to give a rough timescale?  I'd happily take any session available if that helps.  Appreciate that their is a lot of demand for the service  I'm just trying to understand the barriers to gaining a place and how it all works.  Best wishes  Shel REPLY - Hi Shel Thank you for your email.

It's great that so many people are advocating for their health  just such a shame it's taking a long time to access. Hopefully more life will be offered more resources for your contract to meet the demand especially with the recent news regarding wegovy. Thanks for answering my questions. The above question  is the last one from me. Promise!  Have a lovely evening.

Just wanted to share a couple of things as I missed your call on Monday.  I am currently using wegoy 1mg prescribed privately. I have been taking this for a few months now. I have been calorie counting and I am in a good routine of tracking my food using nutracheck  I also weigh all of my food to ensure that the calories I'm consuming are as accurate as possible. I have been making good habits and my goal now is to focus on starting some exercise and incoperating good nutrition.  Wegoy has been life changing for me personally and has helped me to recognise all of the cycles and emotional eating I have been trapped in for most of my life.  Sadly  I am just not sure how much longer I will be able to sustain the cost and hope that the course will further help me to manage and work on the issues around my food addiction/habits. Just thought best to share this info with you..

She has long Covid  which she is having rehabilitation for  and also has mobility issues. \n8/18/23 12:39: First BED session 26th July Client was using a lot of negative language about themselves. They said they use food as a way to cope with stress  anxiety and loneliness. Client felt their eating problems began when they lost their mum age 18. Illness  long covid and fibromyalgia  have exacerbated weight gain. Client said their self belief  loneliness and boredom are things that may get in the way of change.

She said that this coincided with the mindfulness she is learning in her long covid occupational therapy sessions. She has cut her hours at work and said she feels this will help with eating. She said she has been binging less when she has been emotional  and instead is having a shower  resting or doing arts and crafts instead. She also said she is bulk making food  which has helped for the days when her illness’ flare up.

They acknowledged their progress on this and felt proud. Client said they really liked session 5 and had reflections on their childhood and how this had impacted their eating.

I have chosen to attend during the pandemic in the knowledge that there is still a risk of contracting the virus. I understand the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has a long incubation period during which time carriers of the virus may not show symptoms yet still be highly infectious. I understand that some people may have the virus but will not necessarily show any symptoms. I understand it is impossible to determine who has the virus and I understand that I must assume that anyone  anywhere could be infected with COVID-19 or possibly infectious. I confirm that I am not currently suffering from any of the following symptoms of COVID-19 and I have not suffered from any of these symptoms in the last 10 days: • Fever (A temperature of 37.8? or above). • A new and persistent dry cough. • Muscle pains. • Headache. • Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties (That are not a pre-existent medical condition). • Severe pneumonia. • Loss of taste and/or smell. • Extreme fatigue. • Runny rose. • Sore throat No Q19. I can confirm that I have not been in close contact of anyone suffering with any of these symptoms in the last 10 days.
